Lisbon is in party, this year the anual city holiday is happening in sync with a national holiday.

This means the common Lisbon worker will get 4 days of paid holiday for free :)

The Lisbon party actually lasts for 2 whole weeks, where you can dance and sing a blend of new-age cheesy pop music. Most of the fun happens during the night.

In order to carry 3 extra days of holidays for the next week (this way i would be able to recover from sunday night) i decided to work for 7 days on my 2nd week (through the weekend).

## 2nd Week

In the beginning of the week i opened a [ticket](https://github.com/paintpoint/paintpt/issues/2) to render a simple square grid on the canvas. This was supposed to be a simple task but it took me a bit to complete.

What would be a good way to render to canvas using react/redux ?

What would be a good data type for the paint app ?

How would it interact with the canvas and the react/redux logic ?

These questions made me start a new sub-project that i named "[redux-canvas](https://github.com/HugoDaniel/redux-canvas)". It is yet another way to draw on the canvas using react/redux.

By the end of the week (sunday, 12) i did not yet had it finished or published, but stay tuned (subscribe please) because a more thorough blog post about all of this is on the way.
