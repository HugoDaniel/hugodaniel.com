More than two years ago I was releasing my bootstrapped drawing application into the world, the "Grid Generator" web app. It was the labor of love and the search for a creative project where I could eventually dedicate a big part of my future life. However, a trip to the Web Summit in 2017 and countless books of lean/market-first approaches were not enough to save it from its fate. It was not a product or service that the market wanted. This did not surprised me, but yet it still consumed a lot of my energy and was a point stronger than my personal project vision for the most part. 
 
Circumstances have taken me to a path where I can work on the drawing app again. Now I am going to give it a twist and turn it into something different. Just for fun.
 
The main idea will be the same: a geometric drawing tool. The objective and approach however will be very different. This time the driver points for the app development are going to be:
 
- Making something just for fun
- No client, no customer, no target audience
- Assume nobody will use it, make it just for the pleasure of making it
- No pricing or market analysis - the purpose is to be fun
- Has to be cool
- Focus on a creative approach to a common problem
- Do it for the love of the craft
  
To top it the development is going to be done around a *mascot character*. This character will ultimately fulfill the role of an assistant (like Clippy but with personality). The app development and story are going to happen through it.
 
### Meet Cliddy

*Cliddy is a simple Web Component made with:*
```html
<cliddy-mascot face=":)" touched-face=":D">
```

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<cliddy-mascot face=":)" touched-face=":D"></cliddy-mascot>
</div>
 
It is time to Shape The Pixel.
