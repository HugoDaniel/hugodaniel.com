I'll explore a simple way to bring the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern into the world of WGSL shaders.

This is just an idea outline, I currently have no implementation for this, and I strongly doubt about it being a good idea that can produce useful results.

### Then why are you writing about it?

!["A cat with two wheels on his eyes"](/images/ecs_socials.png)

Can we leverage the GPU's parallel processing power for more than just visuals? Is it feasable to bring traditional game state management techniques to the GPU?

There are a lot of tradeoffs being taken which I'll try to address at the end.

I guess that increased portability is eventually a motivation, like at the end of this road if things go well, but not the goal.

### ECS - Entity Component System

This is a simple idea that reeks detachment and embraces sparse relationships. The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) explains it much better than I can, and [there are a lot of youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=entity+component+system+explained) that provide comprehensive angles into this subject.

In an Entity Component System, Entities, Components and Systems are concepts that you as a programmer define, but in a way that by default they are unrelated to each other.

Imagine three arrays: one for entities, one for components, and one for systems. Each element exists in its own space, connected only through explicit references.

![A car and a cat driving it, a list of wheels and a list of positions, cat and car share some of these attributes](/images/ecs_carro.png "A cat and car go somewhere, they share the same position, but not the same wheels")

So, ideally Entities and Components and Systems don't know much about each other:

- *Entities:* Things in your game/app (e.g., a player, an enemy, a tree).
- *Components:* The data or attributes of those things (e.g., position, health, color).
- *Systems:* The logic that acts on and changes that data (e.g., movement, collision detection, AI).

The key is that systems work with any entity that has the right components, hopefully making it easy to add or change behavior without messing up the whole codebase.

### Bringing ECS to the GPU

Despite ECS being a very niche solution with short advantages to app and game state representation, for the purpose of bringing it to the GPU, I'm going to make it even simpler and reduce even more its advantages by removing the ability to update the relationships in runtime.

In WGSL you send a shader code string to the graphics api (WebGPU) which then compiles it into the GPU processor code that gets run with whatever settings you have set.

My idea is to exploit this shader code string creation, and use JS/TS to create a massive string with const arrays and lookups already baked-in.

These arrays and lookups would represent the entities and components relationships that were set through JS/TS. It's like using JS/TS as a precompilation language with its Maps and Sets to perform the queries and dump the results in a WGSL string.

The key difference here is that I'll define the relationships between entities and components upfront, in JS/TS, before sending anything to the GPU. This way, the GPU only has to execute the pre-determined logic defined by CPU code (JS/TS).

Ideally in the future someone could minimax this out to produce a highly optimized string ready to run on the GPU. 

### Attractiveness is sweet

WebGPU and WGSL are attractive because they have compute shaders, which are simpler versions of shaders for whatever you want.

Not only that, but unlike WebGL/GLSL, the new WGSL also brings support for pointers and compile time const arrays.

In WebGPU we can create our own pipeline, and dispatch a given entrypoint function of the shader with very specific parallel execution scenarios. I find this a cool thing and wanted to explore it a bit and see how it can be used to implement an ECS.

### Compute shaders dispatches

The rough outline of the simplified ECS for WGSL is this:

- Components are defined as WGSL structs/types.
- JS/TS is used to create the relationships between entities and components
- Systems are defined as WGSL functions that read/update components
- Systems function arguments define the components query they use
- JS/TS parses this system function and performs the queries.
- The final WGSL string dispatches each system function once for each query result

### The code outline

My objective is that in the end I can do something like this in JS/TS and have a final WGSL shader string created:

```typescript
const world = createWorld();

// Create an entity
const PLAYER = world.createEntity();

// Create a position component type (A simple 2d vector)
// and its initialization function (in WGSL)
const POSITION = world.createComponent(`
alias Position = vec2<f32>;

fn init_position(
  position: ptr<storage, Position, read_write>,
  i: u32,
  total_number_of_components: u32
) {
    let space = 2.0 / total_number_of_components;
    let left = -0.5;

    (*position).x = left + float(i) * space;
}

`);

// Create a distance movement type (here using a struct just because yes)
// No initialization this time. (in WGSL)
const MOVEABLE = world.createComponent(`
struct Moveable {
  delta: vec2f,
};
`);

// Relate these two components to the player
world.addComponentToEntity(PLAYER, POSITION);
world.addComponentToEntity(PLAYER, MOVEABLE);

// A movement system, defined using WGSL function
// This function will be called for all entities that
// have the Moveable and the Position components:
// (in WGSL)
world.createSystem(`
fn movement_system(
    moveable: ptr<storage, Moveable, read_write>,
    position: ptr<storage, Position, read_write>) {
    (*position).at += (*moveable).delta;
}
`);

// An input update system, same thing with a WGSL function
// that is called once for all entities that have the Moveable
// component.
world.createSystem(`
fn keyboard_system(moveable: ptr<storage, Moveable, read_write>) {
    const amount: f32 = 0.01;

    // Up:
    if (keyDown(38)) {
        (*moveable).delta.y = amount;
        (*moveable).delta.x = 0.0;
    } else
    // Down:
    if (keyDown(40)) {
        (*moveable).delta.y = -amount;
        (*moveable).delta.x = 0.0;
    } else
    // Left:
    if (keyDown(37)) {
        (*moveable).delta.x = -amount;
        (*moveable).delta.y = 0.0;
    } else
    // Right:
    if (keyDown(39)) {
        (*moveable).delta.x = amount;
        (*moveable).delta.y = 0.0;
    }
}
`);

// The shader string to send to the GPU
const shader = world.generateWGSL();
```

Thats the idea for the API, maybe I'll add a few other small utilitarian functions as needed here and there.

I did a quick rough sketch of this in compute.toys. You can use the arrow keys to move the circles around.

In the end I intend to have a WGSL string somewhat like this: [https://compute.toys/view/1377](https://compute.toys/view/1377).

Outlining it:

- A WGSL string that does one dispatch per system function. With components hardcoded into it in static const arrays.

- Initialization is done inline as much as possible.

- No dynamic updates. A dynamic update of a relationship would imply a string rewrite and WGSL shader recompilation.

I hope that this can be ok for scenarios where the entity component relationships are relatively static or the performance overhead of dynamic updates is acceptable.

### Pros and Cons

There might be some advantages that I cannot exactly measure at this idea stage but only guess: 

- Is there some usefulness in having the state management done in the same language as the graphics?
  - Could this lead to better low hanging fruit optimization opportunities and reduced communication overhead between CPU and GPU?
- Will it be massively slow to re-compile a big shader with everything in it? (i would love to benchmark WGSL compilation times at some point)
  - I think that this could be a major bottleneck, especially for dynamic scenes or frequent updates.
- Can we easily produce mind-bending stuff when the state is tightly coupled with the graphics?
  - There might be some potential here for unique visual effects and gameplay mechanics that make use of the GPU capabilities.
- Debugging will be super hard (if not impossible), but I plan and hope to make some developments here in the near future.
- Performance? I doubt there will be any performance gains at all immediately and I'm not sure I can produce good enough data points to conclude anything on this.

### Conclusion

This post is just the first step in exploring this idea. I have no polished library or API to showcase yet â€“ just a conceptual sketch done quickly.

In the next post, I'll attempt to bring this to life with a more concrete example, hopefully I'll have a bit more clarification on the potential benefits and drawbacks of it.

I'm both excited and apprehensive. Will this experiment crash and burn, or is there a hidden gem here somewhere?

Join me on this journey into the uncharted territory (for me at least) of ECS in WGSL!
