Hi, I am Hugo, from the ancient end of the world.

Nowdays it is still the end of the world but everybody just calls it Portugal.

I was born in Alenquer, a village near Lisbon.

I love poetry and most likely this blog will turn to be a poetry blog about my ramblings.

I also like photography and I tend to avoid the fact that I am a terrible photographer.

But unfortunately I spend all my days programming, something that I love and hate at the same time.
