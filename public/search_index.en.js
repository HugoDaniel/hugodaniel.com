most of the country in the 80's, Alenquer, the village where I was born, was trying to modernize itself in what can be considered an insurgence against its rural past.\nThe context of coming out from a strong harsh dictatorship and having recently joined the european comunity automatically made everyone who did not work a lazy person. Opportunities were everywhere. In fact this was so intense for the newer generations that working was not enough for them to avoid the \"lazy stigma\". You had to explore, experiment, live and enjoy the \"new\".\nI was 6 years old when my parents made their after dinner routine visit to a friends house with the usual purpose of drinking and talking about stuff that seemed to matter. What was supposed to be just another day in the company of friends changed my life forever.\n\"I have finally bought the computer\"\nhe said, on the corridor table there was a box with a screen and keys to press.\n\"It's a schneider\"\nHe turned it on, typed some words on the keys and started a game. The first computer game I saw and got the chance to play.\n\nI had lots of questions in my mind after playing it:\n\nHow is it made ?\nHow does it move as i press the buttons ?\nHow are those colors drawn ?\nHow can i do it ?\nWhere can i get more of it ?\n\nThe world is dangerous\nSlightly older kids were having a blast with the ZX spectrum.\n\nIt became quite famous in Portugal, companies were using it to ease some calculations, kids were pirating cassettes, and there were even local radio stations that used to broadcast entire games through the air (which you could then record in your cassette tape). Electronics done right.\nThe speccy sported an impressive 16 color palette (15 actually, the black is repeated).\n\nApparently limited, these colors provided no limits to the fertile imagination of teens armed with a programming manual (the ZX Spectrum was sold with a programming manual included and no ammount of words can be used to explain the social impact this had).\n\nGravitating towards that tech and gaming oriented crowd made me later aware of a bunch of other computers that were also very important even though they were never famous here.\nSize doesn't matter\nThe Amstrad CPC was a direct competitor of the Spectrum, it also had a base of 16 colors but expanded them into 27 in a \"high-resolution\" mode.\n\nThis was a clear upgrade in comparison to the 16-colors of Spectrum.\n\nIn spite of having more colors this palette shies when put against the mother of all 8-bit computer 16 color palettes:\n\nThese 16 colors alone allow for an amazing expression (if you are into it here is a detailed article on how to reproduce them in RGB).\n\nA kind soul used both color palettes (C64 and Amstrad CPC) to produce a set of comparison images, the C64 images are more natural and its grays are better distributed which in turn allows for slightly more complex shadows.\nAll these color palettes were made to be reproduced in TV screens from the 80's. Some even take in consideration B&amp;W TV's as full 24bit RGB was still a few years away from commodity hardware.\nNowadays\nFast-forwarding for today, a niche of people are still using 16 color palettes and searching for possible combinations of colors that maximize expression. Most of these are related to \"pixel art\" communities and other minimalist art movements.\nTruth is that there is a natural feeling in using colors in sets of 16 related elements. It gives you, the artist, a lot of paths to explore but not many enough to degrade the exploration experience into frustration.\nAs a final exercise I'll leave three different loader screens for the same game. Try to see if you can guess which 8-bit computer is which.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/16-palettes-of-fun/","title":"Palettes 0xF Fun"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/about/":{"body":"Hi, I am Hugo, from the ancient end of the world.\nNowdays it is still the end of the world but everybody just calls it Portugal.\nI was born in Alenquer, a village near Lisbon.\nI love poetry and most likely this blog will turn to be a poetry blog about my ramblings.\nI also like photography and I tend to avoid the fact that I am a terrible photographer.\nBut unfortunately I spend all my days programming, something that I love and hate at the same time.\n\npoesia\ngithub\ntwitter\nrss\ne-mail: mail [[at]] hugodaniel.pt\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/about/","title":"about me"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping-rain/":{"body":"It has passed a year and a couple of months since I started bootstrapping \"a painting web app\".

Specificity wise I put it right after of \"It's a programming project\", or \"It's a web page\". It doesn't say much more than these and whenever I use it people stare at me with that awkward face that blends simpathy with honest disapointment.\nHere is how it happened\nBack in the day I grew tired of my (many) wrong choices in life. This was particularly hard for me since I have always been a lover of what is wrong and bad. \"Wasting\" huge ammounts of time doing code for no reason/purpose at all is not good and certainly not right. Investing years trying to produce CG code worthy of any unknown demoparty and their attendees acids. Realizing that I am not a good coder and still betting my life on the craft. Travelling through deserts only to hope nobody sees my attempts at hoping to intoxicate with colors.\nIt is 5am.\nAnother cold winter morning in Lisbon enhanced by the summer optimized windows and walls of my 37m^2 home. The rain leaks through the windows and I move the small ikea table enough to protect the laptop from getting wet. I don't know why I am forcing myself to wake up this early, perhaps knowing that the queue to heaven is shorter at this time of the day and that maybe god will allow my body and mind the grace of being numb for the rest of the working day.\nI can see work blowing up somewhere later in the day, I can feel it devouring my brain. I need this time to breathe. The warm coffee smell keeps me awake, its scent rises above all the burn bruises my hands acquired in trying to make it half-awake. Maybe the blessing will rain down on me today.\nI have been reading this article about hexagonal grids for some time now. Fuck! Why can't I implement it right ? Why is programming so hard for me ? I have been trying to do this for months now. I have no purpose in it besides avoiding the razors in my day.\nOffset coordinates ? Cube coordinates ? If I was a designer what would I do ? What would I need ?\nHmm....\n\nIt is 7am, my girlfriend will wake up at some point before 8. It is still dark outside, where did I leave the umbrella ? I go out to buy some hot bread to prepare our breakfast.\n2. Holistic approach\nRomance is a big part of bootstrapping.\n3. Mentor\nIn November 2016 the struggle to explain what the project is about led me to apply to a state sponsored funding. In my mind I didn't need the money since I was/am living with low expenses on my savings, but they offered free access to a \"portuguese mentorship network\". Mentorship that I knew that I could not afford and could not survive without. After answering their questions in a 22 page report I waited 5 months and got the response.\nThey liked the idea and decided to accept the project. I have been living the past 4 months with 690EUR/month from them. This is enough to increase my life style, cover my expenses and still manage to save a bit each month.\nThe mentorship has been great. I was not expecting such a high quality work from the mentor that I chose from their huge list of available mentors.\nI have since done the first prototype of the landing page for the graphic design web app https://www.pixnit.com and we have been focusing on applying this work on colors, grids and patterns on the ceramics industry (for a different, but related, product).\nIn september I will add a promotional video for the graphic design app and an open demo.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping-rain/","title":"Bootstrapping rain"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping1/":{"body":"Two months have passed since i quit my job with the plan of taking some time to develop a few ideas that have outgrown me enough to earn the respect of a full-time dedication.\nThis \"Bootstrapping\" post is the first in a series of posts about a quest to a sustainable monthly income.\nTo start i am going to do a painting web application. A simple web app to paint points in a canvas. I call it \"paint.pt\".\n1st Week\nThe week went about fine, in the first days i learned a bit more about JavaScript in order to understand if a framework would be necessary for paint.pt.\nAfter some thinking, a bit of research and some rough implementations of what i thought would be the corner cases of it, i decided to pass the oportunity to use pure JavaScript and use react instead.\nBy the time of this writing i am living in the year 2016. That means the rest of the week was spent configuring a react/redux/immutable/webpack/mocha/selenium/babel/flow/eslint boilerplate repository for it.\nBy the end of the week i realized that the sun was shining outside and so i went for a walk in Lisbon to read a few chapters of the git book.\nThat was it.\nCheck out the other \"bootstrapping\" posts: Bootstrapping 2, Bootstrapping 3 and Bootstrapping 4.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping1/","title":"Bootstrapping - week 1"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping2/":{"body":"Lisbon is in party, this year the anual city holiday is happening in sync with a national holiday.\nThis means the common Lisbon worker will get 4 days of paid holiday for free :)\nThe Lisbon party actually lasts for 2 whole weeks, where you can dance and sing a blend of new-age cheesy pop music. Most of the fun happens during the night.\nIn order to carry 3 extra days of holidays for the next week (this way i would be able to recover from sunday night) i decided to work for 7 days on my 2nd week (through the weekend).\n\n2nd Week\nIn the beginning of the week i opened a ticket to render a simple square grid on the canvas.

I took 3 days off and only worked thursday and friday.\nThis wasn't entirely on purpose, my intention was not to have real \"vacations\", but to enjoy the overall Lisbon party mood. Tuesday was also the first game of the portuguese football team in euro 2016.\nThough i am not a football fan, i do like to watch the portuguese team play with the eventuality of seeing some magical moves by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nI know by experience that everything stops here in portugal when a big football match is going to happen. This is a strong motivator to go out drink some beers with friends in antecipation for the game.\nIt is important to note that a win by the home team is one of the best excuses to party hard. Unfortunately we did not win, it was a tie with Iceland, which meant no after party as a huge victory was expected.\nStill it is better to enjoy the day than to stress with \"having something to do\".

Which comes in stark contrast with the current frontend bundle trends.\nPerhaps in the future browsers will provide us higher-level components that can pack together HTML+JS+CSS in a way that is at least as elegant as Svelte does.\nParcel\nMost bundlers configuration is typically write-once and write-only. It is a pain to maintain and properly configure a bundle.\nParcel does it right by providing sane defaults that don't need configuration upfront. (A bit like the fish shell )\nWhy is a bundler needed if Svelte already has a compiler ?\nA bundler like Parcel provides the extra goodies of allowing us to import strange files directly in our .svelte components.\nStuff like TypeScript and even Rust become a breeze to work with.\nPerhaps in the future bundlers won't be needed. Perhaps even text files won't be needed to code. Unfortunately we need them in our current state of things.\nTypeScript\nThis language has been evolving fast. For now types are the way to go and TypeScript does a great job at typifying JavaScript and preventing those nasty null errors where you least expect(ed) them.\nPerhaps in the future startups will again push towards dynamic languages as a way to bring faster products to market and the \"Move fast, break things\" will make sense again. But for now static is the way to go.\nRust\nRust has a lot of good things. It appeals the front-end crowd as much as the backend people and the language is leveraging those windows of opportunity much better than any other language or community.\nWasm bindgen is a bliss of fresh air, it even works very well with TypeScript.\nWebAssembly\nThis is a total game changer for the next years. As a compile target it will allow near native performance and open the door for a lot of programming languages to be used on the web.\nA new era of web apps is coming thanks to Web Assembly. It is hard to forsee what exactly will this be.\nThere are nevertheless a few cool extensions already being worked on for it:\n\nWASI\n128-bit SIMD\nThreads\nRef. Types\nMultiple value returns and block parameters\nBulk Memory Operations\nNon-trapping float-to-int convertions\nSign-extension ops\nException handling\nExtended name section\nMulti-memory\nGarbage Collection\n\nWeb development is going to be a very different beast in a few moments in time. Lets enjoy the ride.\nConclusion\nI have fetched some ideas from a few repos and forked them into a ready to use template you can start your projects with.\nCheck it out.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/browser-tech-stack-2020/","title":"From Rust to Svelte, what tech stack will I use"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/cleaning-up-for-shape-the-pixel/":{"body":"Moving from Grid Generator into the first version of Shape The Pixel is going to involve the effort of cleaning and pruning the parts that are slightly outside of its intended focus of drawing shapes.\nThis implies product changes that will propagate into technical decisions.\nWhat is going away?\nThings that were done in Grid Generator and that are going to be removed in Shape The Pixel:\n\nLogin/Register (Login with e-mail and social networks)\nPayments (Payment logic and Braintree integration)\nBusiness Logic (\"when to allow a customer to do what?\" - in Shape The Pixel there are no customers, the app always does everything)\nBilling (Invoices and Chargebee integration)\nMost UI components (all JSX is going away and it is going to be done with plain HTML and Web Components)\nDeveloper dependencies (the Grid Generator frontend code only had two dependencies, both are going away: inferno and xxhashjs - others might come in)\nSplit repositories (db code, auth server code, video generator, and frontend code)\nMost WebWorkers are going to be removed for the sake of simplicity\n\nWhat is going to be new?\nThings that are going to be new in Shape The Pixel:\n\nCliddy (an assistant)\nUI (redone and centered on Cliddy)\nShape/Grid drawing mode (new UI with a new logic that sits closer to the creative process)\n\nThe more things change...\nMost things will remain the same, which means these will still work or will only carry small changes:\n\nInfinite grid\nShape - the customizable \"pixels\" editor\nReplay your work\nMP4 export\nShare your work with a link\n\nOne more thing\nAlso, expect a couple of surprises on top of these to be announced here on this blog.

In certain cities you can even map whole migrations as they trend and landlords surf the wave of higher rent prices for at least the same level of preocupations.\nRoughly 18 years ago I moved to Lisbon to study. For me it represented moving away from my village into the unknown. More than going to a big school where I did not know anyone. It was the city that drove my fears and desire to explore and know more. To wander and find new neighborhoods with different cultures and habits than mine.\nNowadays these neighborhoods still exist, but their inhabitants have mostly been evicted and moved to the outskirts. We branded this as \"gentrification\". Gentlemen move to the place where you were previously living (notice that you are excluded from the gentlemen group by definition).\nIn Lisbon this did not happen softly. Most of my friends are now evicted. The red flags are everywhere.\nMy landlord sent me an SMS the other day. He said he wanted to speak to me about some important matters. I cannot think of anything good coming from a conversation with a landlord. He evicted me. Why charge 'n' to normal people when you can charge gentlemen 'n'*4? No problem, time for a change anyway.\nA Lisbon Story (part II - debt)\nThe city has been a major part of my lifestyle for the last 18 years. I managed to reduce my cost of living to under €700/month and still save a little. This was in no small part due to my rent. It might seem crazy but some neighbors of mine even manage to spend less through heroic frugal tactics.\nWith this I decided to collect my savings from the bank and dedicate full-time to develop a painting application that could help me and eventually others to do shapes and patterns like the ones from tiles.\nGrid Generator has been a central part of my life since then.\nSomewhere on my journey I managed to get a grant to work on it. With the obligation to build a company shortly after it finished. It has ended in May.\nIn an unrelated event to the eviction I got contacted by the IRS roughly on the same week that I got evicted. Because I was using my savings before I am old and/or dying from a terminal disease it seems that I now have to pay them a cumulative 10% of some amount for each year that I saved.\nAfter some calculations the IRS lady told me that the total I needed to pay them was more money than I had in my account. Fuck. I mean: FUCK. It is said that in Portugal you can owe money to a lot of people. Rich people. Banks. Mafia. Drug dealers. But you simply cannot owe money to the IRS. Ever. Dark stories are told about people who once owed them money.\n\"Fortunately\" the Portuguese IRS shady tactics are so common that they allow you to pay in small parts and through some other weird mechanics that delay your entry into their shitlist.\nThe words of a friend that is into cryptocurrencies echoed in my mind: \"The current economic system was not made to help you save money\". How I wish he was wrong.\nForward momentum\nGrid Generator has been my testbed for a lot of strange experimentations and ideas. Not only in the approach to solve the problems it intends (shape editor, color picker, etc...) but specially in the code.\nI have rewritten it completely from scratch some 4 times with varying degrees of (in)success. In its current state it is done with typescript and infernojs. While in its previous incarnations used react, vanilla js, immutable js and even did a quick stroll through purescript. It currently runs on top of DragonflyBSD.\nThe project is online and ready to use at https://gridgenerator.com.\nI call it \"version 0\" as it lacks a lot of features (like onboarding) and has all that coder design/UX that you hate.\nConclusion\nTo sum it up, I now have four major problems to solve:\n\nGet money to pay the debt\nGet a house to live\nBuild a company (with what money?)\nContinue improving Grid Generator and start talking about it\n\nI am shifting some of the energy away from Grid Generator to focus it on the first two of these problems and see how it goes.\nI am also going to invest into propaganda now and try to walk the thin line of project promotion and SPAM.\n\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/eviction-and-debt/","title":"Eviction and Debt"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/":{"body":"\nIn April 2016 I quit from the startup I was working to finally do a personal project. Back then the questions everyone asked me were mostly about money \"How are you going to live ?\".\nEven though rent prices in Lisbon have been skyrocketing due to tourism increase and the coming of WebSummit I always had a frugal economical lifestyle. I don't have loans, I don't have \"luxuries\" and I can keep my monthly spendings to what some people view as an heroically low value.\nLooking back it was somewhat natural that when a set of conditions met I thought: \"it's now or never\".\nI spent some months wondering about what kind of project to do. I knew I wanted something ambitious but I got easily lost in the objectives and purpose of the project. With time I realized that the money I had saved was not going to allow me to survive long enough to do a first version of the product and release it in the market.\nThat made me start looking around for investment, preferably some that did not imply selling part of the company (lost fund). That was when I found about StartUp Voucher.\nVery briefly, StartUp Voucher is a community fund from the European Union that is run by the Portuguese Gov. with the purpose of helping out companies in \"idea stage\". Pragmatically this means I get 690EUR/month for 12 months plus the help of an incubator and a mentor.\nThis funding is particularly targeted for ideas outside of the most developed areas of the country. In spite of currently living in Lisbon I was born and raised in Alenquer, where my family still resides. To apply for this fund I made the headquarters of my project there, a place I love and visit on a weekly basis.\nTo further enhance my application I read through the whole 100 page \"Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation\" report (RIS3) for my region. That report made me notice that a software tool for grid based drawings could have a lot of impact in several practical applications for the exporting industries in the Center of Portugal. Like ceramics, textiles and creative industries.\n\nWhen Lisbon was boiling with WebSummit 2016 I was working full-time to apply to this fund. It took me a few weeks and in December I finally finished the application and sent it. After a some months I got the news that my project was one of the 245 chosen to be on the StartUp Voucher. Since around May 2017 that I have been getting 690EUR each month and working in full force on this project.\nDuring this time I have been using their support to fine-tune the project in many ways and prepare myself for the first steps on the market. WebSummit is also being promoted by the StartUp Voucher who encourages all tech startups to try to attend.\nRight now I have a working demo that have been using with some friends and potential users and I am planning to start looking for partnerships in early 2018.\nIn this link I explain why I decided to go to the WebSummit this year.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/","title":"My first funding as a bootstrapper in Portugal"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/from-gridgenerator-to-shape-the-pixel/":{"body":"More than two years ago I was releasing my bootstrapped drawing application into the world, the \"Grid Generator\" web app. It was the labor of love and the search for a creative project where I could eventually dedicate a big part of my future life. However, a trip to the Web Summit in 2017 and countless books of lean/market-first approaches were not enough to save it from its fate. It was not a product or service that the market wanted. This did not surprised me, but yet it still consumed a lot of my energy and was a point stronger than my personal project vision for the most part. \nCircumstances have taken me to a path where I can work on the drawing app again. Now I am going to give it a twist and turn it into something different. Just for fun.\nThe main idea will be the same: a geometric drawing tool. The objective and approach however will be very different. This time the driver points for the app development are going to be:\n\nMaking something just for fun\nNo client, no customer, no target audience\nAssume nobody will use it, make it just for the pleasure of making it\nNo pricing or market analysis - the purpose is to be fun\nHas to be cool\nFocus on a creative approach to a common problem\nDo it for the love of the craft\n\nTo top it the development is going to be done around a mascot character. This character will ultimately fulfill the role of an assistant (like Clippy but with personality). The app development and story are going to happen through it.\nMeet Cliddy\nCliddy is a simple Web Component made with:\n&lt;cliddy-mascot face=\":)\" touched-face=\":D\"&gt;\n\n\n\nIt is time to Shape The Pixel.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/from-gridgenerator-to-shape-the-pixel/","title":"From Grid Generator to Shape The Pixel"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/grid-generator-v0/":{"body":"The purpose of this post is to introduce my personal project: Grid Generator. This is the first post about it since it went online on the 1st of July 2018.\nWhat problem does it solve?\nI have always struggled with design tools. In particular those that came to see the light of the day during the 90's (Adobe I am looking at you).\nThese design tools are clearly targeted at \"pros\" and \"specialists\" (like most of the computer \"stuff\" from/during the 90's). You are not expected to be able to work with them if you are not a specialist or if you did not take at least a course on these tools.\nBeing trained in software development made me look at the works produced by designers with wonder and amazement. I want to be able to at least produce geometric clean shapes that fit well together.\nUnfortunately making even simple shapes in the current design software offer is a daunting task for me.\nThat was my motivation behind Grid Generator: Create simple shapes, easily pick colors, and paint them in a grid, making patterns or more complex shapes.\nI also wanted to bring time into play. Time is an important factor to consider and to work with in Grid Generator.\nWhat to expect?\nA square grid. In this version, and in the upcoming near versions, Grid Generator only supports a base square grid.\nThink of it as pixel art with configurable pixels. Where your moves are being recorded.\n\n\nShape editor\nIn a square grid the base shape is the square. If you click on the '+' button bellow left, it opens the \"Shape Editor\". Here you are presented with a grid made of lines and circles. This is where you customize your square. The intersections are automatically calculated to help you create your shapes. You as an artist/designer only need to connect the dots and build your shape.\n\nYou can pile many shapes on top of each other and change their colors.\n\nTime is an important aspect, you can go back to any previous state of your shapes and re-edit them from there.\n\nAfter your shape is created you can start painting with it.\n\nOr create other color variations of it on the '+' button to the right.\n\nTile Patterns\nI have asked in reddit about software to create tile patterns. A few answers came up but none quite filled my taste. I used this as a motivation to implement automatic tile patterns in Grid Generator.\nIn the menu just click on the \"pattern\" icon, and then on the \"grid\". A blue frame shows up where you can paint inside and everything gets repeated outside.\n\nYou can drag the corners of the blue frame to adjust your pattern to your drawing and create different patterns with white spaces.\n\nReplay your art\nAfter having created something cool you can publish it to share with your friends. Publishing an artwork makes it publicly available in its own page.\nIn there you will see a big \"play\" button that will replay your creative process until the final state is reached.\nCheck it out.\nRemix it\nYou can pick any state of the art being replayed and remix your own version from there on. You can easily create your variations by clicking on the remix button (\"Change It\" on the bottom).\n\nExport\nExporting is currently the only paid feature of Grid Generator. My logic to make this a paid feature was that you can support the further development of this app if you are producing anything of value with it.\nIn the future I am planning to make this a free feature by adding other sources of revenue like instant product creations with your art (bags, t-shirts, etc...) and even selling packs of specially crafted grids.\nAfter paying you can export your work as SVG. SVG is a vector format that is very prone to rounding errors and aliasing, so I also implemented exporting your works as high-res PNG's that solve these issues.\nAnother possibility you have is to export your creative process as GIF or MP4, saving you the hard work of screen recording and editing.\nUpcoming features\nThe next version (v1) will mostly see UI/UX improvements (imo those are critically needed) and some small features with these, like:\n\nPossibility to clear your shapes in the shape editor\nRough onboarding\nSlightly better menus and pages\nFacebook login\n\nAfter these I am planning some major stuff like:\n\nStroke support in shapes\nBackground images in shapes\nLayers\nColor picker enhancements\nTriangular grids and shapes\nCustom base grid editor (create any kind of base grid)\n\nTry it and if you feel inspired tell me which features you would like to see most.\nhttps://gridgenerator.com\nConclusion\nIn its current state Grid Generator is very raw. I did a lot of compromises to get here but the idea is very close to its initial inception in my head from a couple of years ago. Along the way I had the help and feedback of amazing people. I have some upcoming posts planned on them. They helped a lot of this feel way less lonely and in some points I think they believed more in it than me :)\nAlas everything is open source and I am going to start using GitHub bells and whistles in its further development.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/grid-generator-v0/","title":"Introducing Grid Generator Version 0"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/gridgenerator-first-stand/":{"body":"\nAbout a month ago I was planning my WebSummit approach when I realized that I had never been to such an event. Much less have a stand of my project there.\nThat was when I started searching for opportunities to be at events. To train and prepare for the WebSummit.\nBack then I got an invitation to participate in the first aniversary of StartUp Portugal, the portuguese state entity that acts upon the development of our entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nMy immediate decision was to say \"yes\" and use this oportunity to train the speach/pitch/posture in a faire stand.\nThe event took place in the \"beato creative hub\", an old military industrial area that was abandoned for years until they decided to turn it into the next big thing in Lisbon.\n\nAccess wise it is near the river, and although it has a nearby bike path, the entrance is on the inner side, making it difficult to get there on bike or on foot (cars tend to speed and the sidewalks are narrow in that area of the city). The surrounding neighborhood used to be neglected and poor, but now it is thriving with Lisboners looking for different places to hangout due to the tourist pressure present in past common areas of the city (bairro alto, cais do sodré, etc...).\nThat day (4th of October) I arrived a bit earlier than expected to setup my stand and after it I drank a beer to chill out while making my first contacts with the other stands as they arrived.\nThe whole thing was novelty to me, I was there with Grid Generator, the bootstrapped project I've been working on, and things proceeded in three waves during the day:\nWave 1: Lots of people in suits\nAfter a while lots of people in suits showed up. Most of these were just walking around while keeping a safe distance from the stands. Enough not to get approached by any of us there standing.\nSince I was there to take the most of it, I grabed a few flyers and actively went to them to talk about my amazing project.\nTo my shock they were not interested in listening to what I had to say. This was not even a problem with my pitch because they turned me down right after I showed up with a smile and said \"Hello, can I talk to you about my project ?\". Maybe it is a problem with my face.\nIf they were not there for the startups and the people working on them then what were they there for ?\nI decided to deal with it and move along. I guess negative reactions should be expected when going to these events with an active posture (seeking people to speak, instead of waiting for them to speak with you).\n\nWave 2: Nobody\nThe event then had some talks. Unfortunately they were scheduled to happen in a different building than the one we were in. So suddenly everybody left and disappeared from sight. A few important politicians showed up to talk (I saw them at a glimpse) and we were left alone: should I leave my stand unattended ? I decided to stay and hold my ground just in case somebody showed up.\n\nDuring this time my motivation was going down and approaching a local minimum for that day. \"I see... this is mostly a political event.\"\nThat was when I met Pedro from othersigns.pt. He had decided to check out the projects while we were mostly empty. I pitched him when he interrupted and decided to criticise me about my pitch approach:\n\"Why are you talking about your project like it is targeted for the design industry ? I can clearly see it is not, yet you talk about it like it is\"\nWe talked. One hour later he had convinced me to look at it from a different angle and try to push the real innovative things about my project and sell it as a design tool for non-designers. Something targeted for the creative crowd that needs to do some design but don't know/want to work with complex pro tools like the ones professional designers use.\nLots of different possibilities and approaches for Grid Generator came into conversation. It was fun and made the event worthwhile.\nWave 3: Some important people\nAfter the talks ended in the other pavillion a hoard of scouts in suits approached our stands and told the people next to me, in an important tone, that they would have to speak with the secretary of state for the industry.\nIt happenened. She talked to them, took some photos, and promptly decided to ignore most of us in the other stands, talking only to a select few. The other politicians didn't bother to show up.\nStartups were apparently the boring part in this startup event. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, yesterday, was kind enough to give voice to anyone who wanted to speak.\nAfter this I went out. Grabbed a slice of the aniversary cake that they were eating outside (even the cake was outside the stands area), and had another beer while meditating on what had happened. After this I left to dance Kizomba in another part of the city.\nConclusion\nI decided to participate in this event in order to train for our WebSummit stand. Overall it was a fun experience albeit the first of its kind I had. I am not sure I would want to repeat it again if given the chance.\nIt definetely helped me learn a few things about being in a stand and craft a more prepared approach for the bigger event that is the WebSummit.\n\nHere is a quick list of things this helped me learn about being in a stand, some of these are pretty obvious but still worth to keep in mind:\n\nTake an active approach (approach and talk to people). I talked to more people than any of the other stands there.\nDon't grudge if people don't want to talk to you (it is normal)\nYour product demo is not the most important part. People will not get to it if your pitch is not convincing.\nDon't focus on pitching features. Pitch a story instead. It grabs attention better.\nKeep a log of e-mails and reach them a few days later (ask people for their e-mails and not the other way around: don't give your e-mail expecting to be contacted: you won't be).\nEye-candy is important, the stands with the better visual looks got most of the attention.\n\nHope this helps and see you at the WebSummit next week in Lisbon, also take a look at some cool places to eat in the touristic area of Lisbon :)\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/gridgenerator-first-stand/","title":"Grid Generator First Stand"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-fast-is-nothing/":{"body":"One of the fastest functions that can be run inside requestAnimationFrame goes something like this:\n\nfunction fastest() {\n  window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n}\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n\n\nA simple no-op. It does nothing besides requesting to be called in another frame in order to do nothing besides requesting to be called in another frame, and so on.\nA request for nothing that hopefully matches the speed of your monitor v-sync to hastily do just nothing.\nWhich gives us the perfect chance to use the most important skill we have in our life.\nGiving meaning to nothing\nMeasuring the function can be done by placing marks and then collecting them with the performance.measure() function. To avoid placing a mark every frame lets also count them and place it only once every 120 frames. My monitor updates at about 60Hz so this should place a mark every 2 seconds.\nlet count = 0;\n// ^ count each frame\nfunction fastest() {\n  window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n  count += 1;\n  if(count === 120) {\n    performance.mark(\"120\");\n    // ^ place a mark in the 120th\n }\n}\nperformance.mark(\"0\");\n// ^ place a mark before the first frame\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\nwindow.setTimeout(function() {\n  // measure the duration between those two marks;\n  performance.measure(\"120frames\", \"0\", \"120\");\n  const measure = performance.getEntriesByType(\"measure\")[0];\n  console.log(\"120 frames in: \" + measure.duration);\n}, 3000);\n\n\nAt 60fps we get around 16.7ms per frame, 120 frames should run in ~2000ms. Yet after 3 seconds this code prints \"120 frames in: 2148.415\" in the console.\nThis is 8% slower, making it closer to 55fps (18.2ms) than to 60fps(16.7ms).\nIf you thrive in the eccentricities of speed then those 1.5ms are simply unacceptable, lets try to understand what is happening by opening the \"Performance\" tab in the developer tools.\nThe eyes are the window of the soul. And all i see is garbage.\n\nThose big drops in performance are related to the red dots of the Garbage Collector (from here on, just \"GC\"). They mark the time where GC woke up and run through the nursery of temporary objects to clean them.\nThese GC actions happen at the rate that the code fills the nursery heap with temporary objects. The browser then performs a small cleanup on the nursery heap and checks if some of those temporary objects can be promoted to the tenured heap.\nThe Tenured heap fills at a much lower rate than the Nursery and consequently the browser does not check it as often as the Nursery.\nLets try to promote all our short lived objects into something that might be selected to be tenured by the browser, thus reducing the time that the GC spends analyzing our running code and the nursery heap.\nThe execution context is dead. Long live the execution context!\nMy first approach is to remove the first invocation to the requestAnimationFrame() and place it inside a global closure in IIFE style.\nlet count = 0;\n(function() {\n  function fastest() {\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n    count += 1;\n    if(count === 120) {\n      performance.mark(\"120\");\n    }\n  }\n  performance.mark(\"0\");\n  fastest();\n  // ^ call the function directly for the first frame\n})();\n// ^ IIFE\n\nThe idea here is to make the reference to the fastest() function explicitly last for the whole execution of the animation loop by wrapping it in a closure context that is immediatly called.\nThe next step is to remove all obvious objects allocations that happen inside our loop.\nThis means we need to remove all the strings (\"120\" is an object allocation) and all the numbers.\nOne of the great things about closures is that their execution context is available in their children, this means we can place the strings and numbers of our loop in vars in the long-lived closure context instead, making them live between our loop function calls.\n(function () {\n  let count = 0;\n  const limit = 120;\n  const lastMark = \"120\";\n  const firstMark = \"0\";\n  // ^ all vars go here\n  function fastest() {\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n    count += 1;\n    if(count === limit) {\n      performance.mark(lastMark);\n    }\n  }\n  // ^ when the fastest() context finishes there\n  // are no obvious object allocations to free\n  performance.mark(firstMark);\n  fastest();\n})();\n// setTimeout remains the same, this is just for performance measure\nwindow.setTimeout(function() {\n  performance.measure(\"120frames\", \"0\", \"120\");\n  const totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(\"measure\")[0].duration;\n  console.log(\"120 frames in: \" + totalTime);\n}, 3000);\nA speed-freak nighmare is a control-junkie best dream\nThat code above produces the string \"120 frames in: 1990.69\". This is great, it says that our measures were taken before the 16.7ms frame time has passed.\nLets look at the performance tab:\n\nNote that the Nursery is completely gone from our call-stack. There are still some red dots that mostly refer to the Cycle Collector (from here on, just \"CC\") taking control of the code.\nThe CC does a simple job: it tracks cycles in the code.\nA cycle happens when objects refer to each other in a way that their reference count never becomes zero. This can trick the GC to never collect them and forces the need to have a cycle counter running through the code once in a while.\nThe CC is a tricky beast, it does not allow anything else to run while it is running. Our JavaScript stops executing (you can validate this by increasing the zoom on the developer tools waterfall when a CC action occurs).\nFortunately this is not hurting the performance that much and each frame gets rendered bellow their time by the browser. I was starting to have some chills with the idea of having to frame limit the render loop to ensure a constant frame rate.\nThankfully this Intel HD3000 is still good for Nothing at all :)\n\nThanks Raquel Foster for reading this blog and motivating me to write this follow-up on React-Redux-Canvas.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-fast-is-nothing/","title":"How fast is nothing at all ?"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-useful-is-the-javascript-set/":{"body":"In most languages Set's have a clear strong use case: fast union, intersection and difference operations; unfortunately in JavaScript these operations are not readily defined so as an exercise I am going to raise some questions and try to answer them in this post.\nAll code is run on Firefox Developer Edition 57.0b11 (64-bit) in macOS.\nInitialization\nMost of this post will be used to compare Set() with Array() for some common operations. To initialize a Set() I will be constructing it with an Array.\nconst set1 = new Set([1,2,3,4,5,6]);\n\nset1.has(5);\n// true\n\nset1;\n// Set [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]\nUniqueness\nWithout the common set operations defined the JavaScript Set() can be seen as a glorified container that only stores unique elements. When you put a repeated element it actually replaces the existing one.\nThis is quite useful for primitive values.\nset1.add(5);\nset1.add(5);\nset1.add(5);\nset1;\n// Set [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]\n\nUnlike Arrays the value will not be repeated when you add it to a Set.\nFor object values this is not that simple as Set uses references for those values;\nconst set2 = new Set([{ value: 1}, { value: 2}]);\nlet obj1 = { value: 2 };\nset2.add(obj1);\nset2;\n// Set [{ value: 1}, { value: 2}, { value: 2 }]\n\nThe reference is used as the key in the Set, if we change obj1.value above to something else and add it to the Set, JavaScript will see it as a repeated element and replace the existing reference in the Set.\nobj1.value = \"foo\";\nset2.add(obj1); // obj1 is already in the set\nset2;\n// Set [{ value: 1}, { value: 2}, { value: \"foo\" }]\n\nNow just to compare with Arrays, here is a naive implementation to create an array with n values and then filter the unique values in it.\nconst n = 100000;\n// create an array with 'n' random numbers:\nconst initialArray = new Array();\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n\tconst number = Math.round(Math.random()*n);\n\tinitialArray.push(number);\n}\n// naively filter the unique values into a new array\nconst uniqueArray = new Array();\nperformance.mark(\"UniqueArrayBefore\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; initialArray.length; i++) {\n\tconst value = initialArray[i];\n\tif (uniqueArray.indexOf(value) === -1) {\n\t\tuniqueArray.push(value);\n\t}\n}\nperformance.mark(\"UniqueArrayAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"uniqueArray\", \"UniqueArrayBefore\", \"UniqueArrayAfter\");\nconst arrayTotalTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"uniqueArray\")[0].duration;\nconsole.log(arrayTotalTime, uniqueArray.length);\n// 171.08500000000004 63235\n\nIt takes 171 milliseconds to filter ~64k unique values in a 100k elments array. Not bad.\nNow lets compare this naive implementation to just using Set():\nperformance.mark(\"UniqueSetBefore\");\nlet uniqueSet = new Set(initialArray); // easy!\nperformance.mark(\"UniqueSetAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"uniqueSet\", \"UniqueSetBefore\", \"UniqueSetAfter\");\nconst setTotalTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"uniqueSet\")[0].duration;\nconsole.log(setTotalTime, uniqueSet.size);\n// 0.8699999999998909 63235\n\nThat is FAST! ~0.9ms with the same initial 100k array. The good part is that Set does not get worse with the number of elements in it.\nThis is basic JS and the killer feature of Set()'s. Use them when you need a container of unique elements and/or to filter unique elements in any iterable container.\nPresence\nChecking if an element is present is also easy in a Set and arguably an operation quite common for containers like these.\nset1.has(5);\n// true\nset1.has(1337);\n// false\n\nArrays also have a presence function called indexOf: it returns the index of the element or -1 if it is not present.\nTo compare Array.indexOf() to Set.has() here is a quick test that runs 10000 indexOf's (in array) and has's (in Set) for an Array and Set of 100 elements:\nconst size = 100; // the Array and Set size\nconst a = new Array();\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\n\ta.push(Math.round(Math.random()*size));\n}\nconst s = new Set(a);\n\nconst ops = 10000;\nlet indexAll = 0;\nperformance.mark(\"Array Before\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ops; i++) {\n\tindexAll += a.indexOf(Math.round(Math.random()*size));\n\t// ^ just to do some operation\n}\nperformance.mark(\"Array After\");\nperformance.measure(\"Array.indexOf()\", \"Array Before\", \"Array After\");\nconst arrayTotalTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Array.indexOf()\")[0].duration;\n\nlet setValue = false;\nperformance.mark(\"Set Before\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ops; i++) {\n\tsetValue += s.has(Math.round(Math.random()*size));\n\t// ^ same as above just to do some operation\n}\nperformance.mark(\"Set After\");\nperformance.measure(\"Set.has()\", \"Set Before\", \"Set After\");\nconst setTotalTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Set.has()\")[0].duration;\n\nconsole.log(setValue, indexAll);\nconsole.log(\"SET: \", setTotalTime, \"ARRAY: \", arrayTotalTime);\n// SET:  17.68499999999767 ARRAY:  20.924999999995634\n\nA slight difference. Multiple executions give values that are coherent with these (not an outlier).\nSet.has() is faster than the Array.indexOf() even for small Arrays.\nThe difference of execution just gets bigger as the size of the containers increase.\n// size = 1000;\n// SET:  21.014999999999418 ARRAY:  54.00500000000102\n// size = 10000;\n// SET:  17.44499999999971 ARRAY:  398.505000000001\n// size = 100000;\n// SET:  19.770000000004075 ARRAY:  3779.524999999994\n\nSet.has() execution time doesn't seem to differ with the set size. The JS spec tells us why:\n\"Set objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection.\" [*]\nIt does not even bother heating your CPU as my browser probably implements this to be O(shiznit(n)) for a large enough n (I will not go into detail here so I will leave the measurement as an exercise for you as it is always important/necessary to measure Big-O behaviours).\nInsertion speed\nRight now Sets seem really cool, how about we check how fast is the add() method in comparison to an array push(), like we did in the Immutable.List vs Array article ?\nThe code is simple, two loops, one for Array.push() and another for Set.add().\nconst s = new Set();\nconst a = new Array();\nconst ammount = 100000;\nperformance.mark(\"ArrayBefore\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ammount; i++) {\n\ta.push(i);\n}\nperformance.mark(\"ArrayAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"Array.push\", \"ArrayBefore\", \"ArrayAfter\");\n\nperformance.mark(\"SetBefore\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ammount; i++) {\n\ts.add(i);\n}\nperformance.mark(\"SetAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"Set.add\", \"SetBefore\", \"SetAfter\");\nconst arrayTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Array.push\")[0].duration;\nconst setTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Set.add\")[0].duration;\nconsole.log(`Array.push in ${arrayTime}ms; Set.add in ${setTime}ms;`);\n// Array.push in 4.054999999993015ms; Set.add in 20.915000000037253ms;\n\nAh! Arrays are much faster (5x) in insertion than Sets. If you are an experience developer this is not really surprising at all, but still it is nice to check.\nBe aware that insertion speed grows linearly in Arrays and non-linearly in Sets:\n// ammount = 100000;\n// Array.push in 4.054999999993015ms; Set.add in 20.915000000037253ms;\n// ammount = 1000000;\n// Array.push in 17.175000000046566ms; Set.add in 417.03999999992084ms;\n// ^ ~4x more than prev.               ^ ~20x more than prev.\n// ammount = 10000000;\n// Array.push in 349.8299999999581ms; Set.add in 3902.625ms;\n// ^ ~20x more than prev.             ^ ~10x more than prev.\n\nWe could continue, but JavaScript numbers are 64 bit double precision floating point values. Which means that for integer values they will use 52bits of storage for the significand. Which in turn means that for the next ammount (100000000) I would need 650MB of memory just to store the numbers + the overhead of the Array and Set data structures.\nAnother exercise for the reader :D\nIf you are doing a cheap fast logger, then Array is a better choice than Set since it inserts much faster. Set add() is probably implemented to have a better O(some BS here) than the Array push() and it will likely not be much slower than 10x the previous running order. But their measured absolute value is way slower and this is what really matters, always measure your code if you care about performance because overhead can creep in the most unexpected places (I am not sure if this is the case, but still...).\nIteration speed\nIf you are wondering how Set performs in the need to iterate through its elements, wonder no further.\nAgain the two cycles, this time using for..of to go through the Set items.\nconst s = new Set();\nconst a = new Array();\nconst ammount = 100000;\nlet sum = 0;\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ammount; i++) {\n\ta.push(i);\n}\nperformance.mark(\"ArrayBefore\");\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {\n\tsum += a[i];\n}\nperformance.mark(\"ArrayAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"Array.for\", \"ArrayBefore\", \"ArrayAfter\");\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; ammount; i++) {\n\ts.add(i);\n}\nconsole.log(sum);\nsum = 0;\nperformance.mark(\"SetBefore\");\nfor (let item of s) { // &lt;- here\n\tsum += item;\n}\nperformance.mark(\"SetAfter\");\nperformance.measure(\"Set.for\", \"SetBefore\", \"SetAfter\");\nconst arrayTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Array.for\")[0].duration;\nconst setTime = performance.getEntriesByName(\"Set.for\")[0].duration;\nconsole.log(sum);\nconsole.log(`Array.for in ${arrayTime}ms; Set.for in ${setTime}ms;`);\n// Array.for in 4.44999999999709ms; Set.for in 9.239999999997963ms;\n\nNo surprises here. Array sequential values are faster to iterate than Set values (which iterates in insertion order).\n// ammount = 100000;\n// Array.for in 4.44999999999709ms; Set.for in 9.239999999997963ms;\n// ammount = 1000000;\n// Array.for in 9.044999999998254ms; Set.for in 55.14499999998952ms;\n// ammount = 10000000;\n// Array.for in 74.47000000000116ms; Set.for in 180.13999999999942ms;\n\nArrays are faster for sequential iteration of lots of data.\nConverting the Set to an Array is not going to help here because Array.from iterates through the argument to perform the convertion.\nJust deal with it :)\nSet operations\n\nWe saw that Set construction and presence checking are extremely fast operations when compared to their Array counterparts. With this in mind the set operations can be easily and naively done.\nUnion\nconst union = new Set([...set1, ...set2]);\n\nCreates a new set with the unique values on set1 and set2 (no repeated values). If you don't care about uniqueness then just use Arrays and concat() them.\nDifference\nconst diff = new Set([...set1].filter(x =&gt; !set2.has(x)));\nIntersection\nconst intersected = new Set([...set1].filter(x =&gt; set2.has(x)));\n\nSimple as long as you remember that for objects they work with references instead of values.\nConclusion\n\nUse Set() when unique values matter\nSet.has() is much faster than Array.indexOf()\nArray.push() is much faster than Set.add()\nArrays are faster to iterate sequentially\nUnion, Difference, Intersection are easy to implement with Set\n\nSet's are a big part of my project Grid Generator. Keeping these small concepts close to the heart can help you leverage Sets to achieve very good performance even in mobile devices.\nI hope this post was valuable in any way to you. If you are interested here is my take on console.log() and also a look into Immutable.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-useful-is-the-javascript-set/","title":"How useful is the JavaScript Set"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/in-loving-memory-of-immutable/":{"body":"Any JavaScript spaghetti worth its salt won't keep track of its objects references or their updates.\nThese are things that happen between the mind of a chef and the ether of a planned portion with lots of defensive copying.\nImmutable.js aims to reduce these portion sizes to match the ones in fancy restaurants while avoiding ingredients like:\nJSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))\n\n\nTo try out this new pepper lets open the developer tools in a new tab and sharpen our sour-sweet tooth.\n\nHow many calories has the appetizer ?\nIn order to measure the amount of memory that Immutable.js uses by itself lets marinate it in a quick and dirty formula:\n\nOpen the devtools\nDefine a simple array with a single item in it and print it to the console\n\n let test1 = [1337];\n console.log(test1);\n\n\n\nMeasure the memory usage (memory tab of the dev tools)\nLoad Immutable.js directly into the console (copy pasting its minified source directly into the console)\nDefine a simple list with a single item in it and print it to the console\n\n let test2 = Immutable.List.of(1337);\n console.log(test2);\n\n\n\nMeasure the memory usage again\n\nThe key points are 3. and 6. so lets do it and take a look into the memory info. For these measures I am using Firefox Developer Edition 53.0a2 (2017-03-05) (64-bit) in OSX Sierra.\nAfter point 3. I have 2.11MB of used memory with the following layout:\n\nscripts: 37KiB (347 objects)\nstrings: 362KiB (9685 objects)\nobjects: 813KiB (11325 objects)\nother: 849KiB (18365 objects)\n\nThis is for nothing but an empty tab with devtools opened after point 3. in the magic formula.\nNow lets load Immutable.js raw minification and run the rest of the steps.\nAfter point 6.  I have 2.53MB of used memory with the following layout:\n\nscripts: 248KiB (1717 objects)\nstrings: 384KiB (10252 objects)\nobjects: 904KiB (12618 objects)\nother: 933KiB (19984 objects)\n\nImmutable.js makes the memory usage go up from 2.1MB to about 2.5MB. That's around 0.4MB just to load the minified Immutable.js in memory.\nLets keep this value as a reference in further tests. I am keeping these memory snapshots also for further reference.\nHow can we leverage the juice from these 0.4MB into our secret sauce ?\nA list of many secrets\nImmutable allows the discerning chef to cook with well defined ingredients. You can define your own data types and use them as immutable everywhere you want to. To do that the Immutable.Record is their provided interface. \nThe following code uses it to define a data type for a 2D point, with X and Y coordinates, and then create some points with it.\nconst Pt = Immutable.Record( { x: 0, y: 0} );\n\nconst pt1 = new Pt(); // uses x: 0, y: 0 by default\nconst pt2 = new Pt({ y: 123 }); // uses x: 0 by default\nconst pt3 = new Pt({ x: 123, y: 321 }); // uses your provided values\n\nFast-food junkies could do the same in straight JS with the simpler approach:\nfunction PtJS(x = 0, y = 0) {\n\tthis.x = x;\n\tthis.y = y;\n}\n\nlet jspt1 = new PtJS();\nlet jspt2 = new PtJS(0, 123);\nlet jspt3 = new PtJS(123, 321);\n\nSome might even argue that they are not wasting the memory that Immutable is. Master chefs are always looking for opportunities to learn, to study and to teach. \nNow for a simple test, create a list with 10000 of those 2D points and compare memory readings of the Immutable approach with the plain JS approach.\nFirst the plain JS approach (lets assume the constructor is already created as above).\n\nlet testArray = [];\nfor(let i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {\n  testArray.push(new PtJS());\n}\n\n\nAfter measuring this in the Memory tab we get 2.92MB in this layout:\n\nscripts: 228KiB (1692 objects)\nstrings: 384KiB (10251 objects)\nobjects: 1MiB (22688 objects)\nother: 888KiB (19990 objects)\n\nThat seems fair, we get an increase of about 390KiB in comparison to our previous measurement. That should be enough motivation to roll our Chefs Knives suitecase of Persistency and do it in Immutable style to measure it on top of this 2.92MB already in use.\nconst defaultPt = new Pt();\nconst testLst = Immutable.Repeat(defaultPt, 10000);\n\nAfter measuring this in the Memory tab we get 2.91MB. This is a decrease of about 10KiB from our previous memory usage. How is this possible ? Is the data even there ?\ntestLst.first().x;\n// returns 0\ntestLst.size();\n// returns 10000\n\nYep, it's all there. Immutable.js allows you to take good care of your memory, but as with all sharp knifes you need to know how to avoid hurting yourself. Lets dive a bit further to understand what is going on and how to master these data structures.\nMaster Chef Mystery Boxes\nOne common misconception about immutable data structures is that there is a lot of useless copying being done. In fact this is so common that there are even JS libraries based on it. Playing with the flavour of common things note the most typical data structure in functional languages.\nThe single linked list.\n\nSupposed that this is a immutable list. It is not possible to add, remove or change its values without returning a new version of it.\nDoes this mean that we need to copy all of it when we need to put a new value in it ? Not necessarily. We can just create the new list item and make sure its pointer is targeting the beginning of the original list.\n\nThis works because the list is immutable, we know for sure that the original list won't change so it is possible to reuse its values, no copying is involved in this.\nAs before, our new immutable list is again defined by its first value, which in this new case is our new value.\nMaster the simple cuts first\nMany operations are possible on our immutable single linked list that leverage the fact that it is an immutable list.\nOperations like head (return the first value in the list) and tail (return all the items in the list except for the first) are almost instantaneous to implement. For head we just return the value of the first item and for tail we just return the first item pointer value (which is an immutable single linked list, in this case, our original 3 value list).\nConcat\nJoining two lists is one of those simple operations that is worth your time and attention in order to understand it. If we have 2 different immutable lists that we want to join we need to go to the first list and adjust the last pointer of the last item to point to the first item of the second list.\nHere it is in pictures:\n\n\n\n\n\nConcat is a heavy operation, it mostly depends on the size of the first list. There are a few tricks to make it faster.\nTo keep it simple I am not going to go much more into this and move to the point.\nThe best recipe is made of many subrecipes\nThe list holds data. That's why it's called a data structure. Now what if instead of directly putting our data in each list item we could instead just point to the data ? Like this:\n\nThe list effectively now holds a way to reach each value instead of the real values. We can get more generic and greatly simplify it by saying that in each list item there is a recipe to reach each value. In the above picture this recipe generalization is represented by the red arrows.\nLet me try to simplify it with the hope that it might stand out the intended purpose.\n\nThe term recipe is not chosen by chance: it represents something that must be done to produce the value that the list item holds.\nIf we follow the recipe in each item we can get to the intended values. For instance, suppose that this is a list of JS Number's, a good recipe to produce the value would be to just call Number() on the data. If it was a list of String's, a good recipe would be to call String() on the data. This also holds for very complex values, say this is a list of balanced tree's, or your favourite custom complex data type, a recipe is the way to construct the value, could just be following a pointer but perhaps that would not be a very useful constructor due to being too general.\nLazy concat\nIn our previous look into concat we noticed that it was a heavy operation, requiring a full copy of the first list that we want to join. When working with immutable data there are only a few of these \"heavy\" operations that do need a full copy.\nNow that we are taking quality steps as chefs how about we use a recipe for concat ?\nInstead of doing a full copy of the first list, just copy the first element and make it point to a recipe. That way, no matter the size of the lists, concat would be done in a single operation (the first item). Here it is in a picture:\n\nNow if we need the second element of the list the recipe will be followed to get it.\nThat is a simple recipe:\ncopy the first list up to the needed value, if the copying is done but the intended value is not yet reached then start going through the second list values (without copying them). In the case we want the 2nd value of a concat'ed list a single copy will happen because we already copied the first item when concat was called. This is a case where the recipe is itself the whole concat operation, meaning that it will only copy until the end of the first list and after it will use the reference of the second list.\nThis recipe approach is usually known as laziness and typically enhanced with a cache of results to avoid copying and constructing the same values over again (this caching approach is known as \"memoization\").\nCuisine du monde\nImmutable.js makes good use of these techniques to avoid doing work when necessary and unnecessary copies. Their approach is lean and well thought, clearly separating the values from the way they are traversed.\nLets look at our Immutable approach again:\nconst defaultPt = new Pt();\nconst testLst = Immutable.Repeat(defaultPt, 10000);\ntestLst.first().x;\n\nA few things stand out:\n\nWe are always using the same reference defaultPt instead of creating a new value in each item.\n\nThis is possible thanks to immutability, if we change it we are effectively creating a new value and a new list.\nImmutability encourages reutilization and is typically a GC friendly approach.\n\n\nRepeat just returns a recipe (thunk)\n\nNo heavy work is actually done, it just returns a way to access and construct the values\nWe used 10000 but could have used infinite with no performance or memory hit\nWork is only done when values are being requested and only up until them.\n\n\n\nImmutable.js also uses a few other tricks to speed up common operations. For instance their List approach uses deques, which means that it keeps your list split in two, so [1,2,3,4,5,6] is kept by Immutable as [1,2,3] and [6,5,4] (reversed rest). This is a very simplified explanation of it, but in practice it allows for very fast insertions in the beginning and end of the list (faster than JS arrays).\nConclusion\nImmutable is certainly a different way of doing JS. Given the normal tendency JS coders have to lean more towards object oriented concepts, immutable feels like the schrodinger's immigrant in a foreign land.\n\nI hope this post was in any way useful to you. Immutable sure is a fun library to get to know and work with. \n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/in-loving-memory-of-immutable/","title":"In loving memory of Immutable.js"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/introducing-deno-tag/":{"body":"Deno is gaining traction. A TypeScript runtime based on the Rust language and the V8 engine commonly associated with Node.js, or seen as the \"new Node.js\". After trying it out, I feel that Deno is much more than that. \nDeno is a new thing. A new thing that gets it right and manages to improve even the few parts that were already top-notch in Node.js/JS.\n\nHow cool is Deno?\nTechnicalities apart, the heart of Deno resides in the URL. It is how modules get referenced, and your work gets exposed to the world—giving you the flexibility to distribute it as you please (in your super-private VPN org, maybe?).\nHaving the URL as the core is a driving force for a few base design decisions.\nNaming things as closely as possible to what they are is a very nice improvement to the already great JavaScript module system. No more extension assumptions when importing modules (this means that import Rabbit from \"magic\" no longer works: where is \"magic\" located? is it a .js ? a .ts? a folder with a default index.js export? Some 3rd party \"package\" in your packages cache? Which version? or is it any other kind of file that your chosen bundler decides to import for you?\nDeno also carefully shares a set of API's with the browser, allowing lazy devs like me to compound the knowledge of standard JavaScript browser API's, bringing it to places outside the browser.\nThe security model granularity resembles the OpenBSD pledge approach. It forces the module execution into a restricted-service operating mode set by each permission specific flag and allowances. If your module tries to do something that was not whitelisted, it will throw an exception.\nThe Deno style guide for contributors is a great read and can serve as a base for the code style guide in companies that lack it. The included linter rules (deno lint) already do a great job at enforcing a part of these guidelines.\nIf you are now starting a new project or trying to refresh some old codebase, then Deno might give you that fresh edge that your project needs.\nDeno as a preprocessor of HTML\nOne of the things that attracted me initially to Deno was that it includes with its single binary deno the ability to bundle dependencies and run tests. No more Webpack. No more Jest. Think of it as TypeScript with batteries included - btw, why doesn't tsc resolve imports and outputs bundles? Because it's a \"compiler\" and not a \"linker\"... yeah, whatever.\nWith Deno, I get in its single binary, a simple API, and a set of tools to use from the Command Line Interface.\nNow, what if it would be possible to run Deno from within an HTML file?\nYes, like PHP but with Deno munching TypeScript. \n\nNevermind the &lt;?php&gt; here's the &lt;deno&gt; tag\nThe deno_tag is my first Deno module. I have been using it in the simple drawing web app I am building (Shape The Pixel).\nThe idea is that you can include a &lt;deno&gt; tag in your project's HTML files and then preprocess them into regular HTML files.\nWhat does this new tag do?\nIt runs the deno command on the specified file and replaces the &lt;deno&gt; tag with its output.\nHere is an example, suppose you have this file called advanced_logic.ts with this content:\nconsole.log(\"PHP is the best computer language ever invented!\");\n\nJust an example. The &lt;deno&gt; tag would transform something like this:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;deno run=\"advanced_logic.ts\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nInto this:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PHP is the best computer language ever invented!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nIt runs something similar to deno run advanced_logic.ts and pipes the execution's output directly into the location of the &lt;deno&gt; tags. \nThe tag can handle other attributes besides run. It can also bundle your modules with &lt;deno bundle=\"my_app.ts\" /&gt;. Perfect for including within &lt;script&gt; tags and having the HTML file include a bundle of your code and its imports.\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Super Advanced Concepts Inc. Like Alien Magic Actually.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n&lt;deno bundle=\"my_app.ts\" /&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nJust call the deno_tag CLI on your build scripts or release playbooks to have the HTML files ready to go.\nThe possibilities are endless\nPreprocess your static assets?\nBundle the SVG's into a single string?\nCall mom?\nPing the coffee machine?\nThe &lt;deno&gt; tag is here for the rescue!\nWhy not use PHP?\nI love PHP and use it whenever appropriate. It is my favorite backend language for the web. The PHP \"include\" logic is great and resembles this somehow (&lt;?PHP include \"something.php\"; ?&gt;). However, I tend to like to work closer to front-end development, and keeping these HTML/Web parts in TypeScript is the wave to surf these days 🏄‍♂️.\nWhy not use /bin/sh?\nI don't know why 🤷‍♂️.\nConclusion\nThe README.md file in the deno_tag repository includes a couple more examples and a more detailed description of its parts. Check it out.\nThis is also available as a deno.land/x third-party module here.\n\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/introducing-deno-tag/","title":"Introducing the <deno> tag"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/lisbon-as-an-inspiration-for-my-project/":{"body":"\nRecently I was somewhat \"forced\" to think about the story behind the idea I am working on. If you go to these startup and entrepreneurship events you will see that most projects have some kind of a story behind them.\nEither they start up in a garage (Apple), or they decided to improve their hobbyist girl discrimination app (facebook), or they just somehow were blessed by some mystical event that got their idea and team together to disrupt the universe.\nWhen my reality clashed with that one I realized that I did not have a special motivation to do a pattern and shapes app besides my desire to make a cool project come to life.\nSo I decided to do what it seemed like the best approach to move forward: I lead myself into a spiral of paranoia and depression for not taking in consideration the necessary planets alignment.\nAfterall, why am I doing what I am doing ?

You can step this up a bit by following the string with JS objects and/or strings. Like this:\nconst v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log(\"Vector v1: (\", v1.x, \",\", v1.y, \")\");\n// or just:\nconsole.log(\"Vector v1:\", v1);\n\nTry it in your developer tools console (Ctrl Shift i, or in mac Cmd Shift i).\nThis is a particularly simple and helpful way to properly debug JavaScript. Specially if your code is creating code or functions in runtime, making it hard to setup breakpoints in the debugger window.\nBut who needs breakpoints when we have console.log ? :)\nColorful console.log() composer mode\nBesides its simplicity, my next favourite thing in console.log is that it also allows you to pass a format string to be replaced with what you want:\nconst v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log(\"v1 (%i, %i)\", v1.x, v1.y);\n\nThere are a handful of other string substitutions you can use.\nWhile apparently this is not a big improvement over the simplest mode, it can be used to do a few things that would not be so easy otherwise.\nColors in console.log\nYou can style your output with CSS through the %c substitution:\nconst v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log( \"%c[Vector 1] %c(%i, %i)%c\\nin object %o\"\n           , \"background: #242; color: #bada55\"\n           , \"background: #424; color: #c0ffee\"\n           , v1.x, v1.y\n           , \"\" //&lt;- clears style\n           , v1\n           );\n\nDynamically create your output\nYou can also compose the log format string with code and pass it the args as needed.\nSuppose you are logging messages that can have a varying number of attributes:\nconst someMsg =\n  { type: \"WORKER_ERROR\"\n  , action: \"division\"\n  , args: [123, 0]\n  };\n\nfunction logMessage(msg) {\n  let logFmt = \"%c[%s]%c - %c%s%c\";\n  let logArgs =\n    [ \"background: #242; color: #bada55\"\n    , msg.type\n    , \"\"\n    , \"background: #424; color: #c0ffee\"\n    , msg.action\n    , \"\"\n    ];\n  if (msg.action === \"division\") {\n    logFmt += \": %i / %i\";\n    logArgs.push(msg.args[0]);\n    logArgs.push(msg.args[1]);\n  } else {\n    logFmt += \" with args %o\";\n    logArgs.push(msg.args);\n  }\n  // finally print it:\n  console.log(logFmt, ...logArgs);\n}\n\nlogMessage(someMsg);\nMeasuring console.log()\nAnother thing to keep in mind when using console.log is that it is not free. It does come with a performance hit, how much exactly ? Lets measure it like we did for requestAnimationFrame():\nFor this test I am going to print just 32 simple console.log messages. I know that this is not a lot, it actually is nothing when compared to using console.log on mousemove events or any other fast firing event, but it should be enough to test.\nperformance.mark(\"Before\");\n// print 32 lines\nfor(let i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++)\n  console.log(\"One of the simplest console.log() possible\", i);\nperformance.mark(\"After\");\nperformance.measure(\"console.log\", \"Before\", \"After\");\nconst totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(\"measure\")[0].duration;\nconsole.log(\"console.log() in %ims\", totalTime);\nperformance.clearMarks();\nperformance.clearMeasures();\n\nIn my Firefox Developer Edition (56.0b1) console it prints\n\"console.log() in 15ms\"\n\n15 milliseconds is a lot of time in a computer perspective, specially since we are just printing 32 messages, it is about 0.45ms per message.\nTo keep it in perspective here is the time it takes to parse a huge 128KB JSON string:\nfunction jsonParseAndMeasure(jsonStr) {\n  performance.mark(\"jsonStart\");\n  const json = JSON.parse(jsonStr);\n  performance.mark(\"jsonEnd\");\n  performance.measure(\"JSON.parse\", \"jsonStart\", \"jsonEnd\");\n  const totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(\"measure\")[0].duration;\n  console.log(\"JSON.parse in %ims\", totalTime);\n  performance.clearMarks();\n  performance.clearMeasures();\n}\n\njsonParseAndMeasure(\"HUGE JSON STRING HERE\");\n\nFor a 128KB JSON string it prints:\n\"JSON.parse in 0ms\"\n\nHmm... maybe that is not enough, lets increase it to a 2MB JSON string:\n\"JSON.parse in 0ms\"\n\nOk... what about a 50MB JSON string ?\n\"JSON.parse in 17ms\"\n\nThats more like it. About the same time it took console.log to print 32 simple messages. There are a few attenuating factors for this in production, but it is good to keep this in mind when leaving those debugging messages in your production code ;)\nBuffering console.log()\nThere is an alternative if you have your reasons to use console.log in production code: buffering.\nInstead of printing each message as it comes, lets place them in an array and dump it in a single console.log call every second or so.\nlet buffer = [];\n// use a log function instead of directly calling console.log:\nfunction log(str, args) {\n  buffer.push({ str, args });\n}\n\nfunction printBuffer() {\n  // start by copying the buffer and clearing it\n  const buf = buffer.slice(0);\n  buffer = [];\n  // dump the buffer in a single console.log call\n  if (buf.length &gt; 0) {\n    let logStr = \"\";\n    let logArgs = [];\n    buf.map(msg =&gt; {\n      logStr += \"%s, %o\\n\";\n      logArgs.push(msg.str);\n      logArgs.push(msg.args);\n    });\n    console.log(logStr, ...logArgs);\n  }\n  setTimeout(printBuffer, 1000); // run every 1000ms\n}\n\nprintBuffer(); // &lt;- start it\n\nThat should save you some performance complaints.

This simple character that will serve as the base for my next drawing app has been a source of fun in recent days.\nIt is a throwback to the days where virtual assistants were displayed with an avatar without \"skills\" or \"actions\" or whatever Siri now has. An agent to be used as a narrative controller of a story that I am not sure where will lead me.\nThe more I work on it, the more the idea of making \"products\" on top of real characters grows in me, up to the point where I am starting to believe that Cliddy can not only be the main central point of the whole UI, but also the focus and target of the entire project.\n\nLike Clippy, the old Microsoft Office assistant, my Cliddy is initially intended to be helpful, communicative, and an enhancer of what can be done with the tool being presented to the user. A natural bridge from the product owner's mind into the product user interactions and intentions. Except \"Shape the Pixel\" is not a product. It is meant to be tool with personality, a daydream of sorts with all its degrees of madness.\nA large spectrum\nAll app assistants are typically well-intended. Some are even sugar-coated to the extreme (Hey Siri, how's it going?). Some are not that sugar-coated and prefer a more dehydrated, linter type list of suggestions that show up in some modal or sidebar to help or guide you. Regardless of the style of virtual-assistant, the well-intended part is a common assumption.\n\nBut what if it isn't? What if, in my case, Cliddy is instead an arrogant, pretentious prick? A real gem of an asshole? (like me, aha) What if Cliddy could be a nagging evil character that is just there to purposefully annoy and alienate you? Would you still use a product or a tool with such an agent? How would it \"assist\" if it is actively fighting against the user? (an assistant with a marked personality, like the Star Wars robots - yes, I am watching The Mandalorian).\nMaybe when centering the UI of a tool around a character/assistant, it can be possible to detach it from its attitude. What if the benefits of having an assistant are not so much about it being helpful but more about having an intermediary human-like presence in the UI? (an anthropomorphized UI element - even if it happens to be symbolically evil). Will the active presence of some agent on the UI by itself outweigh its direct helpfulness? Will it make the app more engaging and fun to use? \nI don't know the answers to these questions.

This came within the WebSummit context, he wanted to be personally with some of the portuguese startups that are going to attend the WebSummit next week.\nThis event would take place in the old National Coach Museum in the near future: today.\nI guess that I got it because of my participation on the \"Road2WebSummit\" series of events that I was selected to be part of. Road2WebSummit is focused in coaching (pun intended) startups so they can be well prepared for the WebSummit. It tries to fill the gap of our lack of an official \"entrepreneur\" culture, although we do have a lot of background at being unofficially entrepreneurs as it comes attached to being a poor country in a rich continent. Now we just need to know how to capitalize on that and channel it through proper \"startupian\" gymnastics.\n\nThe invitation added that the dresscode was a \"dark suit\". That was a problem for me since I don't have any suits and did not intend to buy or loan one. I decided to dress somewhat nicely with what I had around without leaning too much towards informality.\n\nAlmost everyone suited-up for the event, which let me feeling a bit out of place initially, but that all went away once inside.\nThe museum is amazing! I had never been there and kind of regret it since they moved to the new \"modern\" place next door and closed this one (now labeled the \"old\" one).\nThere was still some old coaches around and the ceiling decoration is still beautiful as people always told me it was. At the end they placed chairs for everyone to sit for the speech.\n\nThe president arrived after a few minutes. He talked for a small bit, introduced the economy minister and the websummit people. He is known for his improvisation skills and for the hability to charismatically make quick decisions. After all the personalities had spoken he then passed the word to the startups. Whoever wanted to speak could introduce themselves and their company/ideia to everyone else.\nHere is the video of his speech (he translates from portuguese to english as he goes).\n\nAbout 90 people talked. That was the number they said, personally I did not count and unfortunately after a while my brain was not able to process any more \"ideas\" or startup names. I was spilling buzzwords through my ears. I think the winner buzzwords were \"AI\", \"Machine Learning\", \"Disruptive\", \"App\", \"Intelligent\", \"Deep learning\", \"3D Printer\" and some others I can't recall.\nNear the end we took a group picture, and before everyone left they gave some drinks and pasteis de belém while Marcelo was being invaded by people taking selfies with him.\n\nOverall it was a fun event I even met an ex-teacher from my university that is now trying to work out an idea to increase bike usage in Lisbon.\nI hope another opportunity like this happens soon, maybe then I can also take a selfie with the Prez. :D\nMeanwhile checkout how I got to participate in the StartUp Portugal events.

Here is an example of a basic canvas component:\nexport default class Canvas extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    let canvas = findDOMNode(this.refs.canvas),\n        ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n    this.props.onContext(ctx);\n  }\n  render() {\n    const { width, height } = this.props;\n    const canvasCx = `Canvas ${this.props.className}`;\n    return (\n      &lt;canvas className={canvasCx} ref=\"canvas\"\n              width={width + \"px\"} height={height + \"px\"}\n              style={&nbsp;{&nbsp;display: \"block\" } }\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  };\n}\nCanvas.propTypes =\n  { width:     PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  , height:    PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  , onContext: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n  };\n\nTo increase reusability the context is passed to the parent component where it can be used by its developer sprawling moisture of creative juices.\nHere is an example of a component that draws a simple grid using the Canvas component defined above.\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from \"react\";\nimport { findDOMNode }                 from \"react-dom\";\nimport Canvas                          from \"./Canvas.jsx\";\n\nexport default class GridCanvas extends Component {\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this.state = { ctx: null }\n  };\n  _renderGrid() {\n    const {&nbsp;color, lineWidth, squareSize\n          , offsetX, offsetY\n          , width, height\n          } = this.props;\n    const {&nbsp;ctx } = this.state;\n    // adjust for vertical screens:\n    const limit = Math.max(width, height);\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.moveTo(0, 0);\n    // draw the horizontal lines\n    for( let y = offsetY % squareSize; y &lt; limit; y += squareSize) {\n      ctx.moveTo(0, y);\n      ctx.lineTo(width, y);\n    }\n    // draw the vertical lines\n    for( var x = offsetX % squareSize; x &lt; limit; x += squareSize) {\n      ctx.moveTo(x, 0);\n      ctx.lineTo(x, height);\n    }\n    ctx.lineWidth = lineWidth;\n    ctx.strokeStyle = color;\n    ctx.stroke();\n    ctx.closePath();\n  }\n  render() {\n    const { width, height, cursor, color } = this.props;\n    const { ctx } = this.state;\n    if( ctx ) {\n      // canvas render commands go here\n      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);\n      this._renderGrid();\n    }\n    return (\n      &lt;Canvas className={ `GridCanvas ${this.props.className}` }\n              width={width} height={height}\n              onContext={ ctx =&gt; this.setState( { ctx } ) }\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  };\n}\nGridCanvas.propTypes =\n  { color:      PropTypes.string\n  // ^ color for the stroke of the outline of the grid\n  , lineWidth:  PropTypes.number\n  // ^ the width, in pixels, for the grid line\n  , offsetX:    PropTypes.number\n  , offsetY:    PropTypes.number\n  , cursor:     PropTypes.string\n  // ^ the mouse cursor to use when mouse is over the grid\n  , squareSize: PropTypes.number\n  , width:      PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  , height:     PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  };\nGridCanvas.defaultProps =\n  { cursor: \"default\"\n  };\n\nThe CanvasRenderingContext is kept in the state and then used in render() to clear and draw the shapes. This way the code is run in sync with the React DOM flow.\nThis works very well if you intend to draw single frame art, however since it is coping with React lifecycle flow it might not be the best approach if you intend to have 60fps animations because the React logic will be running alongside your context drawing code in those precious 16ms of the frame.\nYou can try to optimize your React UI with shouldComponentUpdate and you should. But it is still going to contend when your UI hasn't changed and all you want to do is to update the &lt;canvas&gt; with a master piece of an animation.\nReact, but only partially\nLuckily React is not intrusive and \"react-dom\" is intended to be used along standard HTML/JS code. This allows developers to only use React on certain parts of their website, the aspiring artist can then use it for most of the parts of the app and keep the &lt;canvas&gt; outside of its logic.\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;React and Canvas&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"react-root\"&gt;\n      &lt;!-- react goes here --&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;canvas id=\"animation\"&gt;&lt;/canvas/&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://fb.me/react-15.0.1.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.1.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n      var animNode = document.getElementById(\"animation\");\n      var ctx = animNode.getContext(\"2d\");\n      function loop(t) {\n        window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);\n        // draw something on the canvas\n      }\n      window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);\n      // React renders on the \"react-root\" node\n      ReactDOM.render(&lt;MyApp /&gt;, document.getElementById(\"react-root\"));\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nAll is good if you don't intend to make the &lt;canvas&gt; high-speed animation interact with the React part of the code.\nIf you want to communicate between the &lt;canvas&gt; and React then you will have to adopt some interaction strategy (e.g. passing a callback as a prop; using plain JS events; etc...).\nHowever if you have been through the trenches, your battle proven developer experience is probably telling you that this is an optimization trade-off that will quickly grow into a pessimization.\nState will most likely start to accumulate outside and inside of both parts as communication starts becoming more intricate and managing it will give you with many scars to heal.\nRedux will make good for all our sins\nRedux defines a unidirectional flow of data on your application. It uses a single store to hold the application state and allows it to be updated by a pure function that computes the next state based on the actions dispatched by the app. They call the pure function a \"reducer\" and you can have as many of them in your app as you want.\nThis is within the spirit of pure components: something that always produces the same output if fed with the same input. When used with React it opens the door to simpler optimized components with predictable state.\nUnfortunately the CanvasRenderingContext is not pure, its functions rely on a bunch of inner state that can change outside of their scope. This makes it hard to master and to manage (on the other side it has sprawled a counteless number of JS libs to work with it).\nIt also makes it difficult to integrate with Redux which by design expects pure actions and state. It is useless to keep the CanvasRenderingContext in the store and update it with a reducer because its drawing functions will change it outside the pure flow of Redux actions.\nTo make things a bit worse, high-performance canvas applications are encouraged to follow a set of destructive/impure practices which are hard to follow if using React/Redux.\nIntroducing redux-canvas\nWhat if along with the Redux actions that update an app pure state we could issue painting actions to be performed in the impure canvas context ?\nThis is what redux-canvas is meant to do. It allows you to keep your UI running purely with well defined components and their respective lifecycles, while giving you a shortcut to call functions on registered canvas contexts.\nIt is a Redux middleware that works by keeping a Map() of CanvasRenderingContext's that persist between redux actions, and then it passes the Map() to the functions you specify when dispatching the action.\nThese functions are called within a requestAnimationFrame().\nThis way your impure code will be playing together with the pure code without messing with it. You can keep your UI pure while playing with canvas as you see fit (perhaps even trying to keep it pure as well).\nIn the next post I will write some usage examples with animations and also create a few helper functions to ease the usage of redux-canvas.\nMeanwhile checkout my take on console.log(), a quick look into ImmutableJS and my performance measurements on JavaScript Set.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/react-redux-canvas/","title":"React - Redux - Canvas"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/surfing-2017/":{"body":"2016 was a year of change. I stopped working full-time as a programmer and decided to dedicate some of that time to personal projects. I made plans.\nDuring the course of the year most of those plans got changed, a lot. My intention was to build \"paint.pt\", a online painting tool, while supporting myself with some savings and with the money i could make by training people in programming skills.\nI took teacher training and got a teacher certificate with the highest possible grade as i was full time on it.\nThen got a few schools contacts that needed trainers for specific modules of some courses.\nThat was when I collided head-on with the portuguese reality of a fragile economy. I knew jobs were better here for programmers than for most other professions, so i was already somewhat mentally prepared to embrace a harsh reality.\n\"I'll pay you next week\"\nAfter a few courses money didn't came.

Front-end development has become so complex that it is hard for any single person to master it.\nHow much harder would life be if a single index.html was used to drive all of the development instead of all those Create-React-App/Babel/WebPack/npm/yarn/d/sass/styled-components/optimizers? \nI don't know how to answer this but will try to shed some light on a simpler, more \"naked\" approach for web app development.\nTo start there are at least two problems with using a single index.html as the only management file for the app:\n\nNo TypeScript support (or any other transpiler language, only JS, GLSL, and WebASM supported)\nNo way to easily manage 3rd party dependencies dependencies (dependencies)\n\nThese two will be the subject of my next post. For now, I am going to lay the ground for a simple index.html-only approach.\nA common structure for most apps\nThe common structure I plan to follow is something like this:\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;!-- Page meta --&gt;\n&lt;!-- &lt;link&gt;'s go here after the meta stuff --&gt;\n&lt;!-- &lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;'s go here --&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Feature flags as class strings in body --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Modals go here --&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n    &lt;!-- The content being shown goes here --&gt;\n  &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;template&gt;'s go here --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;'s go here at the end --&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\nThis structure makes some compromises but overall is enough for most complex apps. It is not that different from a normal HTML page 🧐.\nJavaScript modules are being loaded at the &lt;head&gt;, which is ok because module scripts are deferred by default and do not block the parsing of the rest of the document. They could go anywhere, I prefer to keep the &lt;body&gt; for the main logic and more immediate scripts.\nWith this in mind, here are 3 common things to a web app that can be done in such a simple structure without much effort:\n\nGlobal loading state (full-screen loading)\nRouting (what to show according to the URL being rendered)\nPlace common HTML parts/assets without repeating them (templating/components)\n\nGlobal Loading page\nA loading page that fills the whole screen is something that most web apps have, some even distract us with cool animations while loading.\nIn the above structure, the loading page goes into the modal area. Right before the &lt;main&gt; content. This allows heavy content like &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;img&gt; to be placed as &lt;main&gt; children and fully load (shaders, image data, etc) behind it, before clearing the loading state and showing them to our friends.\n...\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"loading\"&gt;Loading&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n  ...\n\nThe whole visible space gets covered with that loading &lt;div&gt; which is then removed when all the things that the app needs for a good first run are ready.\nHaving the loading upfront on the index.html without needing any JS to first show it also helps our karma score in the bots&amp;spiders purgatory that purge the web we all love into useful cinder blocks.\nRouting\nNo lib is going to be used for routing. Routing is going to consist of simple manipulations of the browser history with popstate and pushstate. The basic approach is:\n\nRead the current route from the window location\nClone its corresponding &lt;template&gt; into the &lt;main&gt; tag\nInside it adjust the relevant &lt;a&gt;'s and other link navigation tags to perform a pushState instead of their default behavior\n\nFilters can be applied to only consider &lt;a&gt;'s that have relative paths, or that do not have the rel=nofollow attribute\n\n\nonpopstate clone the correspnoding &lt;template&gt; into the &lt;main&gt; tag\n\nThis is intended only for web apps as an effort to reduce the amount of JS and leverage the features already at hand. For anything similar to regular pages the browser behavior is more than good enough, no need for JS there.\nThis approach should work well if the web app uses less than 20 or 15 possible routing patterns. Most web apps likely average at some number under 10. This simple approach should be more than enough. There is no need in my foreseeable use cases to use anything more complex like the DOM or any big library to manage routes.\nI will evolve this into a very simple routing/templating library to be announced soon(ish). For reference, here is some code that I did for a template engine in one of the many Grid iterations: old routing code.\nI appreciate the browser's approach of associating page state with history, however, for a web app I find it simpler and more manageable to keep these two things separate:\n\nRouting seen as pure functions of navigation only transformations\nApp state in its own separate tarpit.\n\nHTML Templating\nStamping and repeating a common HTML structure in a couple of places is a frequent routine that most web apps do. Be it for menu entries, list items, or even whole parts like sidebars or modal and toast elements. Finding a common HTML structure and repeat it when needed with small adjustments is a stapled practice.\nHTML templating has many technicalities and possibilities. Most JS frameworks commonly solve it in their own way with different degrees of justifiable complexity.\nWeb browsers already provide a very flexible and complex way to do templating through the Web Components suite of technologies. For most of my cases plain HTML will be prefered and written directly at that index.html. For the other cases where DRY speaks louder a simple static \"copy/paste\" tag will suffice, a small prototype of this could be something like:\ncustomElements.define(\"template-content\", class extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({ mode: \"open\" })\n        .appendChild(\n          document.getElementById(\n            this.getAttribute('from-id')\n          ).content.cloneNode(true))\n  }\n});\n\nThis small code defines a new WebComponent tag &lt;template-content&gt;, this tag reads an element id from its from-id attribute, then gets the corresponding element on the DOM for that id, clones it, and replaces itself with it.\nThis is useful because it provides a quick way to stamp HTML/SVG content on the document. Helpful to replicate SVG elements, lists, and node sub-trees on the client-side.\n&lt;nav&gt;\n\t&lt;button onclick=\"tool('undo')\"&gt;\n\t\t&lt;template-content from-id=\"tools-button-content\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;template-content from-id=\"tools-undo\" /&gt;\n\t&lt;/button&gt;\n\t&lt;button onclick=\"tool('draw')\"&gt;\n\t\t&lt;template-content from-id=\"tools-button-content\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;template-content from-id=\"tools-draw\" /&gt;\n\t&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n\n&lt;template id=\"tools-button-content\"&gt;\n&lt;!-- Some complex content here --&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;template id=\"tools-draw\"&gt;\n&lt;!-- Some other complex content here --&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\nConclusion\nKeeping a single index.html might be just enough for a simpler naked approach to app development. If there is no need for big dependencies, versioning tracking files, transpilers, and all that, this could very well be good enough. It works directly on top of what browsers already provide and hints at a simpler, leaner, style of development.\nIt does not have TypeScript support and it also does not automatically resolve dependencies and bundles them.\nThese are two open problems with this approach that I plan to show a possible solution that is on par in simplicity with this one. That will be the subject of my next technical post (likely to come out next week). Stay tuned.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/using-just-an-index-to-develop-a-web-app/","title":"The Zen of index.html"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/vi-is-not-vim/":{"body":"When dinossaurs ruled the earth there was a young kid that had just installed Red Hat Linux 5 on his computer.\nFascinated with the \"OS for the elite\" he was about to experience a devouring frustration.\nThe kind that gives rise to dark divinities that come to haunt you in your sleep for years to come:\nTrying to exit vim.\nAfter a few unsuccessful atempts the computer power switch was the only option left. Like that the dream of a promising carreer in elite-land was shattered for that young boy.\nThat young boy was me.\nHigh tech editor, low tech coder\nMy stubbornness always took the best part of my reason and vim was my editor for years to come. Since rough starts are the perfect driver for a good love story I then ditched it to take a stroll in netbeans land. After a while a pardon was due and got back to it again. Then I ditched it again for Visual Studio. Got back to it again. And so on.\nCode editors today try to do everything and a pair of boots. Even vim, known for its minimalist looks, is very prone to config-pr0n worthy of the most wild and nasty fantasies.\nI'll show you mine if you show me yours\nAt one point I got myself in the middle of a config discussion between developers. They were arguing about good .vimrc config options and plugins for vim.\nI decided to participate and show my ~60 lines .vimrc file. They laughed. It was so small. Almost useless.\nThat got me thinking:\nWhat do i really need in a code editor ?\nAfter giving a hard thought on my usage/preferences and some possible optimizations I took a look into the market of code editors and decided to upgrade from vim to vi (by vi I mean nvi 1.81.6, still maintained and developed here ).\nThe rest of this blog post is about some nvi parts (vi, not vim), in particular some parts that are percieved as limitations. I will run through them and try to provide arguments that favor them and reasons to use them. Have your salt and pepper at hand before reading further.\nMinimal config file (.exrc)\nThe nvi config file is named .exrc, here is my current setup:\nset showmode\nset showmatch\nset ruler\nset shiftwidth=2\nset tabstop=2\nset verbose\nset leftright\nset cedit=\\\nset filec=\\\n\n9 lines only. No maintenance. No BS.\nThese options are mostly similar to those in .vimrc, a special note for cedit and filec, these have a =\\&lt;TAB&gt; (the &lt;TAB&gt; is the actual tab character there after the \\).\nThe cedit property sets the character to trigger command expansion in the vi command colon mode. The filec sets the the character for file name expansion (auto-complete) when opening a new file inside vi (e.g. with :e).\nAll of these are well documented in the man page.\n$ man nvi\nNo unicode support\nThere are some vi implementations that support multibyte characters like nvi2. But for this blog post I am assuming your vi is plain nvi.\nNo multibyte, wide-char, wtf-8, extended codepoints. Although those are very important to learn and master I do prefer to keep code in plain strict single-byte ASCII (UTF-8 supersedes it).\nWhy ?\nIt keeps the language coherent with the programming reserved words (more than logic constructs, while, for, if, are english words).\nIt makes it perfectly visible when an accidental wide-char is inserted (particularly helpful if you are using a keyboard layout that does not use the US key-mapping). This is good to make sure your code is available to read on every system, regardless of locale (it even works if someone opens the code you wrote in an editor that is set to default to UTF-8 encoding).\nAnother good thing is that it works with a wider variety of fonts. Some monospace terminal fonts can't correctly display all UTF-8 characters.\nBut I sometimes need to write documents with strange characters\nThat is one of the scenarios where I would use another text editor. nvi is strictly a code/config editor.\nNo syntax highlighting\nThis is another personal preference. It has been a long time since I had to worry about syntax when producing code. If you still struggle with syntax then please use syntax highlighting, it will help those special words stand out.\nOtherwise why not give it a try without syntax highlighting for a while (a few weeks to be slightly above the habituation threshold) and measure how you perform ?\nIt does help to keep your functions small and easy to read.\nComments are shown with their true weight and your commented code is promoted to the same importance as your production code.\nYour focus will be in semantics and it is easier to get into it without the syntax aggressively jumping at your face.\nFast undo\nLike in vim the undo in vi is very convenient but has a slightly different way of operating. Instead of pressing u multiple times to go through the various undo levels and then ctrl-r to redo, in vi you do it by pressing u once to undo and the '.' to go through the various undo levels.\nTo redo you press u twice (undo the undo) and then '.' to go through the multiple redo levels.\nI think this is slightly more coherent and it also makes use of the '.' (repeat action) operator in an arguably more logical way.\nLike in vim, you can use the U command to restore a line to the state it was before the cursor was placed on top of it (undoing all the chances since that time).\nNo visual mode\nThere is no visual mode in vi (visual mode as in pressing the v command and using your movement keys to select an area of text).\nAt first this might seem like a big handicap, but vi shares a few commands with vim that once mastered can make you more productive than using the visual mode.\nMarks m&lt;insert letter here&gt;\nYou can setup marks in text, if you type mx it will define the mark x at the current cursor position. Typically these are used to move quickly through the file and go to certain marked positions. For that the ' command is used followed by the mark character name (moves to the line) or with the ` command (moves to the exact cursor position of the mark). To move to mark x do 'x (assuming you did mx in some place before).\nMarks can also be used with other common commands like yank, delete, etc..., so instead of using the visual mode you can yank or delete to a a mark set at some position.\nTo do that use the t or f commands, like ytx (I read it as: yank to x), it will yank all lines up to (but not including) the line at mark x. To include it use the f as in yfx.\nNo tabs\nTabs was a feature that I used a lot in vim, unfortunately they only work with vim, so if you want to run a shell command or have a terminal to read compiler output you will need to use them with some other kind of tab system.\nOn my journey to the limits of usefulness I found myself using vim tabs together with tmux tabs and terminal (osx) tabs.\nAfter those crazy days (months ?) I finally decided to ditch all tabs and stick to a single tool for that purpose, one that is versatile enough to cover my use cases for tabs.\nDo one thing and do it well\nTmux is my current tool of choice, nowadays I don't use terminal tabs or text editor tabs. I leave that work for tmux, an amazing productivity tool that allows me to work fullscreen in zen mode with the code.\nPanes in vi\nLike in vim you can split your window with panes, these are useful to use another section of code as a quick reference or to do some quick yank/past in vi between files/sections.\nThe pane system in vi works slightly different from vim. To vertically split the window you can also use the :vs, but to horizontally split the window :sp won't work. In vi the command to horizontally split a window is the :E, as in Edit (the same as :e but horizontally split).\nTo switch between panes ctrl-w will immediately move your cursor to the next window pane. Instead of pressing twice like vim you only need to press it once. This is hard to get used to at first but it is also hard to live without once used to it.\n\nNo macros\nOne feature that I consistently used in vim was macros (vim q command). It was easy to create bundles of commands and run them to do your repeated text tasks or grunt work. Very useful when replicating huge data files or setting up a big JSON test file.\nIn vi you can also use the power of macros through buffers.\nBuff it up\nBuffers are easy to use, you can prefix your common text manipulation commands (dd, yy, etc...) to a named buffer. To do that start the command with \"&lt;buffer name&gt; where &lt;buffer name&gt; is any letter from a-z.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\nTo delete 4 lines and place them into buffer a \"a4dd\n\n\nTo paste buffer a to the current cursor position \"ap\n\n\nTo view all your buffers go to ex mode (:) and do :di b\n\n\nWho needs macros when you have buffers\nWrite a few commands to be executed in your file, place then in a buffer and tell vi that you want to execute the buffer:\n2)\n4dd\nG\n\nLine by line:\n\n\nmove two lines down\n\n\ndelete 4 lines\n\n\ngo to the end of the file\n\n\nPut these into a buffer named c with \"c3yy (yank 3 lines into buffer c), and whenever you want to run it just do @ c. Undo u also works nicely with buffered commands.\nUpgrading from vim to vi\nThere are some cool benefits in using vi like how fast it is and how it handles huge files without a problem.\nnvi also performs well in this benchmark of editors\nThe case for vi is like any other editor: a matter of getting used to it and keep perfecting your skills through it for what it really matters: writting great code.\nConclusion\nUse what you are more confortable with. There are tradeoffs in every editor (even the mighty visual studio code does not allow you to work without syntax highlighting on...) and today nvi fits nicely with my way of working and approach.\nI hope this post to be used as a initial reference and motivation to those that are looking for a more minimalistic way of doing things. I don't intend it to start flame wars.\nYou know all of these are just my opinions :)\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/vi-is-not-vim/","title":"vi is not vim"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/websummit-opening-night/":{"body":"\nWebSummit first day came with a mix of up and downs sprinkled with the duality of having the desire to scream with euphoria versus admiting that the event is nothing special to avoid stressing about it.\nThis week I was contacted by their team to go up on the main stage with some of the startups that were present in last week event with the President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. That gave me cold sweats even though I knew it was nothing special. The idea was just to go on stage when they called for us and be there representing our startup scene.\nEarly in the morning, I went to the venue with high hopes of doing my registration and never think about WebSummit until the main stage opening night thing. Unfortunately they told me that registration would only happen after 12h, which made me go back home to spend the rest of the day printing and cutting flyers and cards to hopefully distribute to people at the event.\n\nLater at night, I had the meeting point with the WebSummit team nearby the pavillion where the opening night was going to happen. They routed all of us through a tunnel that gave access to the spectators area of the pavillion. From the speakers that attended I really enjoyed Margrethe Vestager, the european comissioner for competition, she spoke about markets and taxes to tech companies. I also liked a lot of the speech that António Guterres gave, the former prime-minister of Portugal and now secretary-general of the United Nations who spoke about the biggest difficulty of our generation: climate change.\n\nThe cerimony was closed with the current prime-minister of Portugal, António Costa, and the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, who both pressed in a button that made a lot of confettis cannons explode. Before that they invited the portuguese startups the stage, where I was included. I used the chance to take a few pictures and wave at Guterres and Margrethe when by chance they looked at me.\n\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/websummit-opening-night/","title":"WebSummit opening night. Sharing the stage with Paddy Cosgrave"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/":{"body":"\nI don't know where hackers (as in infosec wizards) eat in Lisbon. We do have a strong background of using things beyond their intended purpose (we call it \"desenrascanço\" and it is a basic trait of being born in the culture that has sprung here for centuries).\nAs is this post is intended for tourists looking for a typical experience.\nIf you are visiting Lisbon chances are that you will spend your time around the most touristic areas of the city. In this post I want to share with you some places and dishes that we love and are generally ignored by tourists. I don't pretend to be Anthony Bourdain or any of those youtubers that don't respect what they are eating and only go to fancy restaurants to say in the end that it is cheap and good.\nDon't fall for that. Be a proper tourist and avoid the \"Torre de Belem snowball\" at all costs. I have only seen snow 2 times in my life and it was not in Lisbon :D\n\nIn Portugal we always seat to have lunch and dinner. We don't eat walking. Traditionally everyone takes at least an hour to have lunch. It is kind of a big deal. People here are very proud of their food. There are many categories of places to eat but locals range them between \"fancy restaurant\" and \"fast-food joint\". Somewhere between these two lies our honorable \"tasca\" (tavern &lt;= tasca &lt;= simple restaurant). A glorified tavern with a very peculiar set of skills, namely: very good and inexpensive local food.\nWhat to expect\nIn a tasca you can expect at least the following:\n\nNo cameras looking over you, the balcony or the employers * Never trust a business that tracks you and/or doesn't trust their own people\nOpen kitchen * Take a peek through the open window inside the kitchen and say hi to the cook\nFreshly peeled hand-cut fried potatos * For your pleasure\nPressured wine * We split wine into two major groups: white/red and then inside this group mature/green (or is it the other way around?). Try them all! :)\nA balcony if you are just warming your stomach * Yes, we sometimes eat standing at the balcony if it is something really fast\n\nIn the heart of Lisbon\nHere are 4 tascas that I can think from the top of my head and which I recommend in the touristic area of the city. Don't expect to see \"hackers\" as in computer wizards in them but typical portuguese folks eating. Chose the one near you when you get hungry.\n\n\n\"Casa das Bifanas\" in Rossio - \n\n\n\"Popular do Capelo\" in Chiado\n\n\n\"O Trevo\" in Pc. Camoes - \n\n\n\"A Parreirinha do Rato\" in Rato\n\n\nThings to keep in mind\nThe main reason you step inside a tasca is the food. The second main reason is also the food. The list of reasons is long and every item of the list is food.\nAt the end of the list, down in the footer in a small font are lots of little details that you happen to notice when you are a regular client. These details are infinite and a new one pops out every time you step inside a tasca.\nDuring lunch hour these are very busy places. The waiters are typically running and rushing while being seriously professional. They are in a no-bullshit mode, they know you want to eat and they know you will love the food.\nThe kitchen can close outside of eating hours and only small meals are served.\nThey are somewhat noisy and you can expect to see people screaming if there is a football match going on.\nWhat to eat\nDishes are more or less the same in most tascas. Try these.\nStarter\n\nCroquete (meat roll)\nChamuça (triangle with curry chicken)\n\nSoup\n\nCaldo Verde (kale soup)\nSopa de legumes (vegetables soup)\n\nFish\n\nPolvo à lagareiro (octopus with olive oil)\nPeixe espada (swordfish)\n\nMeat\n\nSecretos de porco (pork)\nBife à casa (steak)\n\nDrink\n\nBeer\nJar of wine (ask for the pressured white wine if you want the full experience)\n\nDessert\n\nArroz doce (sweet rice)\nCafé (ask for an extra bagaço if you want the full experience) * \n\nIf you just want a snack or something other than a full-meal, then try out our \"Bifana\". A steak sandwich. Goes well with beer.\nIntro to Portuguese pastery\nOur pastery is a bit different from the european cakes (because we never saw ourselves as a part of europe until +-40 years ago).\nWe have mostly french influences and also things from all over the world but to keep it short you can generally find fresh original cakes mostly made with sweet egg yolk. We put egg yolk in most of our cake recipes. I have heard several explanations for this, the most convincing one for me is that in convents nuns used the egg light to iron and starch the church clothes, then to avoid wasting the yolk they invented all of these different cakes that you can see in most cafes.\nOur pastery shifts radically in some seasons, we have a whole range of cakes and snacks that are only done in christmas and some in easter.\nYou can find some brazillian pastery, which are heavy in condensed milk (sugar + milk cooked under pressure) and some variations of these with our traditional egg yolk. Just try whatever pops your eye :)\nConclusion\nExplore Lisbon, it has many secrets and hidden gems. Our ways might seem a bit strange, clumsy and hard to get into at first, but peeking through the sweet spots can reveal a humble, seasoned and balanced culture (with earned scars of fighting hard against slavery, discrimination, inequality and dictatorship/power surges). If you are here next week for the WebSummit lets hang out and have a drink :) Here is my contact at the bottom. Take a look at why I think Lisbon is an inspiration for my project.\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/","title":"Where do local hackers eat in Lisbon"},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/":{"body":"\nPersonally I find it impossible to answer this question. I feel that it was not me who actually took the decision to go to the WebSummit. Even though I did.\nIt all hapened through a sequence of chained events that led me to have to decide to buy a discounted alpha ticket to go there.\nAt first the WebSummit has two big \"no\"'s: the price and if you can actually get something useful from it. I can argue that there is some pressure to go when you have the whole city talking about this conference and you know quite a few people that are going there. How can you miss the even where supposedly everything is hapenning ?\n\nMy project is a web app to help people work their graphical ideas without having to learn pro software so that they can use these ideas in their daily lives. Technically it is a grid where each element has itself a customized grid inside. Besides this it also has a cool way to help select colors that match and work well with each other.\nI have not yet released it, so I don't have any market data to show off. I am not looking for investment for two main reasons: I want to bootstrap it and it currently is in an early stage (almost fully developed but still before market).\nI talked beforehand to some people that went to the 2016 edition, and they said that it's a big event, so big that it is confusing to be there. Also most people that go are looking for investment. All these people that I talked to work for some company that paid their tickets, so I had to keep that in mind when considering their opinion (myself being a bootstrapper).\nBecause of this initially I had decided not to go. Then I talked to my mentor and he insisted that I considered the pros and cons of going and not going.\nI then changed my mind into going to the WebSummit because he convinced me that the potential to expand my contact network and talk to people that might be interested in the project was something that at this stage would be very good overall.\nHence the decision to give WebSummit a chance. I applied to their \"alpha ticket\", got selected after a quick interview and they sold me a ~520EUR pass available. This was a lot for me to pay. Even considering that I would be getting 3 tickets and a stand there for my project during one day. But I bit the bullet considering that I am living in Lisbon and that I would have no further big expenses.\nThat was three months ago, meanwhile I have already considered and reconsidered my previous decision, and my current status is still a bit doubtful about the WebSummit as a worthwhile experience for a bootstrapper. I am certainly not going to look for an investment (like most people apparently go) and the real benefits that I think I will obtain are not easily tangible (personal development and enrichment, maybe some hope of having inspirational talks with different minded people).\nMaybe in WebSummit I will meet people that can open my mind to other different kinds of funding. Maybe in the future I will do a kickstarter campaign or some other kind of funding project.\nRight now I know that at least I get the chance to be in the same place as Al Gore and other great thinkers...\nIf you liked this post check out Lisbon as an inspiration for my project\n","id":"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/","title":"Why I decided to go to the WebSummit?"}},"docInfo":{"https://hugodaniel.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/16-palettes-of-fun/":{"body":348,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/about/":{"body":47,"title":0},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping-rain/":{"body":432,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping1/":{"body":110,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping2/":{"body":132,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping3/":{"body":145,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/bootstrapping4/":{"body":153,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/browser-tech-stack-2020/":{"body":326,"title":5},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/cleaning-up-for-shape-the-pixel/":{"body":189,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/eviction-and-debt/":{"body":394,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/":{"body":267,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/from-gridgenerator-to-shape-the-pixel/":{"body":143,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/grid-generator-v0/":{"body":462,"title":5},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/gridgenerator-first-stand/":{"body":534,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-fast-is-nothing/":{"body":511,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/how-useful-is-the-javascript-set/":{"body":932,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/in-loving-memory-of-immutable/":{"body":1080,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/introducing-deno-tag/":{"body":480,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/lisbon-as-an-inspiration-for-my-project/":{"body":229,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/mastering-console-log/":{"body":492,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/meet-evil-cliddy/":{"body":256,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/meeting-the-president/":{"body":286,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/react-redux-canvas/":{"body":796,"title":3},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/surfing-2017/":{"body":258,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/using-just-an-index-to-develop-a-web-app/":{"body":789,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/vi-is-not-vim/":{"body":999,"title":2},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/websummit-opening-night/":{"body":180,"title":7},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/":{"body":537,"title":4},"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/":{"body":273,"title":3}},"length":31},"lang":"English"};
