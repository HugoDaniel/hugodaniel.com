		<p>More than two years ago I was releasing my bootstrapped drawing application into the world, the &quot;Grid Generator&quot; web app. It was the labor of love and the search for a creative project where I could eventually dedicate a big part of my future life. However, a trip to the Web Summit in 2017 and countless books of lean/market-first approaches were not enough to save it from its fate. It was not a product or service that the market wanted. This did not surprised me, but yet it still consumed a lot of my energy and was a point stronger than my personal project vision for the most part. </p>
<p>Circumstances have taken me to a path where I can work on the drawing app again. Now I am going to give it a twist and turn it into something different. Just for fun.</p>
<p>The main idea will be the same: a geometric drawing tool. The objective and approach however will be very different. This time the driver points for the app development are going to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making something just for fun</li>
<li>No client, no customer, no target audience</li>
<li>Assume nobody will use it, make it just for the pleasure of making it</li>
<li>No pricing or market analysis - the purpose is to be fun</li>
<li>Has to be cool</li>
<li>Focus on a creative approach to a common problem</li>
<li>Do it for the love of the craft</li>
</ul>
<p>To top it the development is going to done around a <em>mascot character</em>. This character will ultimately fulfill the role of an assistant (like Clippy but with personality). The app development and story are going to happen through it.</p>

      "content": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Here is a template for your new web app project: <a href=\"https://github.com/HugoDaniel/svelte-template\">Svelte + TypeScript + Parcel + Rust</a></p>\n<p>The web is a big open platform that keeps evolving with the URL at its core.</p>\n<p>We have a lot of tech and frameworks at our disposal to chose when starting a new web app in 2020.</p>\n<p>There certainly is a lot of mud to crawl into, from an all-in vanilla JS approach up until an all-out React with a 100+ dependencies approach.</p>\n<p>Among these there are a few cool things that strike my attention:</p>\n<h2 id=\"svelte\"><a href=\"https://svelte.dev\">Svelte</a></h2>\n<p>Their component approach and state handling is fresh.</p>\n<p>They lean towards using standards like CSS Variables and JS imports in an HTML first compiled approach.</p>\n<p>The Svelte compiler outputs very lean JS code. Which comes in stark contrast with the current frontend bundle trends.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the future browsers will provide us higher-level components that can pack together HTML+JS+CSS in a way that is at least as elegant as Svelte does.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parcel\"><a href=\"https://parceljs.org\">Parcel</a></h2>\n<p>Most bundlers configuration is typically write-once and write-only. It is a pain to maintain and properly configure a bundle.</p>\n<p>Parcel does it right by providing sane defaults that don't need configuration upfront. (A bit like the <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/docs/current/design.html\">fish shell</a> )</p>\n<p><strong>Why is a bundler needed if Svelte already has a compiler ?</strong></p>\n<p>A bundler like Parcel provides the extra goodies of allowing us to import strange files directly in our <code>.svelte</code> components.</p>\n<p>Stuff like TypeScript and even Rust become a breeze to work with.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the future bundlers won't be needed. Perhaps even text files won't be needed to code. Unfortunately we need them in our current state of things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typescript\"><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a></h2>\n<p>This language has been evolving fast. For now types are the way to go and TypeScript does a great job at typifying JavaScript and preventing those nasty null errors where you least expect(ed) them.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the future startups will again push towards dynamic languages as a way to bring faster products to market and the &quot;Move fast, break things&quot; will make sense again. But for now static is the way to go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rust\"><a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org\">Rust</a></h2>\n<p>Rust has a lot of good things. It appeals the front-end crowd as much as the backend people and the language is leveraging those windows of opportunity much better than any other language or community.</p>\n<p>Wasm bindgen is a bliss of fresh air, it even works very well with TypeScript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webassembly\"><a href=\"https://webassembly.org\">WebAssembly</a></h2>\n<p>This is a total game changer for the next years. As a compile target it will allow near native performance and open the door for a lot of programming languages to be used on the web.</p>\n<p>A new era of web apps is coming thanks to Web Assembly. It is hard to forsee what exactly will this be.</p>\n<p>There are nevertheless a few cool extensions already being worked on for it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI\">WASI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd\">128-bit SIMD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads\">Threads</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types\">Ref. Types</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value\">Multiple value returns and block parameters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/webassembly/bulk-memory-operations\">Bulk Memory Operations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/nontrapping-float-to-int-conversions\">Non-trapping float-to-int convertions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/sign-extension-ops\">Sign-extension ops</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling\">Exception handling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/extended-name-section\">Extended name section</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-memory\">Multi-memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc\">Garbage Collection</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web development is going to be a very different beast in a few moments in time. Lets enjoy the ride.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I have fetched some ideas from a few repos and forked them into a ready to use template you can start your projects with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/HugoDaniel/svelte-template\">Check it out.</a></p>\n",
