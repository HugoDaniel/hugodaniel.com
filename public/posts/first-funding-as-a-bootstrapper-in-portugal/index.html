		<p><img src="/images/startupvoucher.jpg" alt="StartUp Voucher ad, it reads: &quot;What if your idea could turn into a company ?&quot;" /></p>
<p>In April 2016 I quit from the startup I was working to finally do a personal project. Back then the questions everyone asked me were mostly about money <em>&quot;How are you going to live ?&quot;</em>.
Even though rent prices in Lisbon have been skyrocketing due to tourism increase and the coming of WebSummit I always had a frugal economical lifestyle. I don't have loans, I don't have &quot;luxuries&quot; and I can keep my monthly spendings to what some people view as an heroically low value.
Looking back it was somewhat natural that when a set of conditions met I thought: &quot;it's now or never&quot;.</p>
<p>I spent some months wondering about what kind of project to do. I knew I wanted something ambitious but I got easily lost in the objectives and purpose of the project. With time I realized that the money I had saved was not going to allow me to survive long enough to do a first version of the product and release it in the market.
That made me start looking around for investment, preferably some that did not imply selling part of the company (lost fund). That was when I found about StartUp Voucher.</p>
<p>Very briefly, StartUp Voucher is a community fund from the European Union that is run by the Portuguese Gov. with the purpose of helping out companies in &quot;idea stage&quot;. Pragmatically this means I get 690EUR/month for 12 months plus the help of an incubator and a mentor.</p>
<p>This funding is particularly targeted for ideas outside of the most developed areas of the country. In spite of currently living in Lisbon I was born and raised in Alenquer, where my family still resides. To apply for this fund I made the headquarters of my project there, a place I love and visit on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>To further enhance my application I read through the whole 100 page <a href="https://www.portugal2020.pt/Portal2020/Media/Default/Docs/EstrategiasEInteligente/EREI%20Centro.pdf">&quot;Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation&quot; report (RIS3)</a> for my region. That report made me notice that a software tool for grid based drawings could have a lot of impact in several practical applications for the exporting industries in the Center of Portugal. Like ceramics, textiles and creative industries.</p>
<p><a href="https://gridgenerator.com"><img src="https://gridgenerator.com/img/logo/grid_generator_logo.png" alt="The logo" /></a></p>
<p>When Lisbon was boiling with WebSummit 2016 I was working full-time to apply to this fund. It took me a few weeks and in December I finally finished the application and sent it. After a some months I got the news that my project was one of the 245 chosen to be on the StartUp Voucher. Since around May 2017 that I have been getting 690EUR each month and working in full force on this project.</p>
<p>During this time I have been using their support to fine-tune the project in many ways and prepare myself for the first steps on the market. WebSummit is also being promoted by the StartUp Voucher who encourages all tech startups to try to attend.</p>
<p>Right now I have a working demo that have been using with some friends and potential users and I am planning to start looking for partnerships in early 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/">In this link</a> I explain why I decided to go to the WebSummit this year.</p>

Arrays are much faster (5x) in insertion than Sets. If you are an experience developer this is not really surprising at all, but still it is nice to check.\nBe aware that insertion speed grows linearly in Arrays and non-linearly in Sets:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#65737e;\">// ammount = 100000;\n// Array.push in 4.054999999993015ms; Set.add in 20.915000000037253ms;\n// ammount = 1000000;\n// Array.push in 17.175000000046566ms; Set.add in 417.03999999992084ms;\n// ^ ~4x more than prev.               ^ ~20x more than prev.\n// ammount = 10000000;\n// Array.push in 349.8299999999581ms; Set.add in 3902.625ms;\n// ^ ~20x more than prev.             ^ ~10x more than prev.\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>We could continue, but JavaScript numbers are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format\">64 bit double precision floating point values</a>. Which means that for integer values they will use 52bits of storage for the significand. Which in turn means that for the next ammount (100000000) I would need 650MB of memory just to store the numbers + the overhead of the Array and Set data structures.</p>\n<p>Another exercise for the reader :D</p>\n<p>If you are doing a cheap fast logger, then Array is a better choice than Set since it inserts much faster. Set add() is probably implemented to have a better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation\">O(some BS here)</a> than the Array push() and it will likely not be much slower than 10x the previous running order. But their measured absolute value is way slower and this is what really matters, always measure your code if you care about performance because overhead can creep in the most unexpected places (I am not sure if this is the case, but still...).</p>\n<h2 id=\"iteration-speed\">Iteration speed</h2>\n<p>If you are wondering how Set performs in the need to iterate through its elements, wonder no further.</p>\n<p>Again the two cycles, this time using for..of to go through the Set items.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">const </span><span style=\"color:#bf616a;\">s </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">= new </span><span style=\"color:#ebcb8b;\">Set</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">();\n</span><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">const </span><span style=\"color:#bf616a;\">a </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">= new </span><span style=\"color:#ebcb8b;\">Array</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">();\n</span><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">const </span><span style=\"color:#bf616a;\">ammount </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">= </span><span style=\"color:#d08770;\">100000</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">;\n</span><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">let </span><span style=\"color:#bf616a;\">sum </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">= </span><span style=\"color:#d08770;\">0</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">;\n</span><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">for </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">(</span><span style=\"color:#b48ead;\">let </span><span style=\"color:#bf616a;\">i </span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">= </span><span style=\"color:#d08770;\">0</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">;

We do have a strong background of using things beyond their intended purpose (we call it &quot;desenrascanço&quot; and it is a basic trait of being born in the culture that has sprung here for centuries).</p>\n<p>As is this post is intended for tourists looking for a typical experience.</p>\n<p>If you are visiting Lisbon chances are that you will spend your time around the most touristic areas of the city. In this post I want to share with you some places and dishes that we love and are generally ignored by tourists. I don't pretend to be Anthony Bourdain or any of those youtubers that don't respect what they are eating and only go to fancy restaurants to say in the end that it is cheap and good.\nDon't fall for that. Be a proper tourist and avoid the &quot;Torre de Belem snowball&quot; at all costs. I have only seen snow 2 times in my life and it was not in Lisbon :D</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/belem_snowball.jpg\" alt=\"Snowing in Lisbon?\" /></p>\n<p>In Portugal we always seat to have lunch and dinner. We don't eat walking. Traditionally everyone takes at least an hour to have lunch. It is kind of a big deal. People here are very proud of their food. There are many categories of places to eat but locals range them between &quot;fancy restaurant&quot; and &quot;fast-food joint&quot;. Somewhere between these two lies our honorable <em>&quot;tasca&quot;</em> (tavern &lt;= <em>tasca</em> &lt;= simple restaurant). A glorified tavern with a very peculiar set of skills, namely: very good and inexpensive local food.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to expect</h2>\n<p>In a <em>tasca</em> you can expect at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No cameras looking over you, the balcony or the employers * Never trust a business that tracks you and/or doesn't trust their own people</li>\n<li>Open kitchen * Take a peek through the open window inside the kitchen and say hi to the cook</li>\n<li>Freshly peeled hand-cut fried potatos * For your pleasure</li>\n<li>Pressured wine * We split wine into two major groups: white/red and then inside this group mature/green (or is it the other way around?). Try them all! :)</li>\n<li>A balcony if you are just warming your stomach * Yes, we sometimes eat standing at the balcony if it is something really fast</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-heart-of-lisbon\">In the heart of Lisbon</h2>\n<p>Here are 4 <em>tascas</em> that I can think from the top of my head and which I recommend in the touristic area of the city. Don't expect to see &quot;hackers&quot; as in computer wizards in them but typical portuguese folks eating. Chose the one near you when you get hungry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Casa+Das+Bifanas/@38.7141819,-9.1400812,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd1933877a14a101:0x58658df29b0791b0!8m2!3d38.7141769!4d-9.1378849\">&quot;Casa das Bifanas&quot; in Rossio</a> - <img src=\"/images/bifanas.jpg\" alt=\"Formely known as &quot;The king of Bifanas&quot;\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Popular+Do+Capelo/@38.7098328,-9.1408684,20z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0xd1933877a14a101:0x58658df29b0791b0!2sCasa+Das+Bifanas!8m2!3d38.7141769!4d-9.1378849!3m4!1s0xd19347ecf1cf809:0xb3685b3298796599!8m2!3d38.7097915!4d-9.1406129\">&quot;Popular do Capelo&quot; in Chiado</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/O+Trevo/@38.7116017,-9.1461413,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd19347fa8fe09bd:0xd6fe73efee2fb6fc!8m2!3d38.710865!4d-9.1430943\">&quot;O Trevo&quot; in Pc.

The second main reason is also the food. The list of reasons is long and every item of the list is food.\nAt the end of the list, down in the footer in a small font are lots of little details that you happen to notice when you are a regular client. These details are infinite and a new one pops out every time you step inside a <em>tasca</em>.</p>\n<p>During lunch hour these are very busy places. The waiters are typically running and rushing while being seriously professional. They are in a no-bullshit mode, they know you want to eat and they know you will love the food.</p>\n<p>The kitchen can close outside of eating hours and only small meals are served.</p>\n<p>They are somewhat noisy and you can expect to see people screaming if there is a football match going on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-to-eat\">What to eat</h3>\n<p>Dishes are more or less the same in most <em>tascas</em>. Try these.</p>\n<p><strong>Starter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Croquete (meat roll)</li>\n<li>Chamuça (triangle with curry chicken)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Soup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caldo Verde (kale soup)</li>\n<li>Sopa de legumes (vegetables soup)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fish</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polvo à lagareiro (octopus with olive oil)</li>\n<li>Peixe espada (swordfish)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Meat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secretos de porco (pork)</li>\n<li>Bife à casa (steak)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drink</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beer</li>\n<li>Jar of wine (ask for the pressured white wine if you want the full experience)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dessert</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arroz doce (sweet rice)</li>\n<li>Café (ask for an extra <em>bagaço</em> if you want the full experience) * <img src=\"/images/bagaco.jpg\" alt=\"Café and bagaço\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you just want a snack or something other than a full-meal, then try out our &quot;Bifana&quot;. A steak sandwich. Goes well with beer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intro-to-portuguese-pastery\">Intro to Portuguese pastery</h2>\n<p>Our pastery is a bit different from the european cakes (because we never saw ourselves as a part of europe until +-40 years ago).\nWe have mostly french influences and also things from all over the world but to keep it short you can generally find fresh original cakes mostly made with sweet egg yolk. We put egg yolk in most of our cake recipes. I have heard several explanations for this, the most convincing one for me is that in convents nuns used the egg light to iron and starch the church clothes, then to avoid wasting the yolk they invented all of these different cakes that you can see in most cafes.</p>\n<p>Our pastery shifts radically in some seasons, we have a whole range of cakes and snacks that are only done in christmas and some in easter.</p>\n<p>You can find some brazillian pastery, which are heavy in condensed milk (sugar + milk cooked under pressure) and some variations of these with our traditional egg yolk. Just try whatever pops your eye :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Explore Lisbon, it has many secrets and hidden gems. Our ways might seem a bit strange, clumsy and hard to get into at first, but peeking through the sweet spots can reveal a humble, seasoned and balanced culture (with earned scars of fighting hard against slavery, discrimination, inequality and dictatorship/power surges).
