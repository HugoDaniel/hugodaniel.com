<p>I don't know where hackers (as in infosec wizards) eat in Lisbon. We do have a strong background of using things beyond their intended purpose (we call it &quot;desenrascanço&quot; and it is a basic trait of being born in the culture that has sprung here for centuries).</p>
<p>As is this post is intended for tourists looking for a typical experience.</p>
<p>If you are visiting Lisbon chances are that you will spend your time around the most touristic areas of the city. In this post I want to share with you some places and dishes that we love and are generally ignored by tourists. I don't pretend to be Anthony Bourdain or any of those youtubers that don't respect what they are eating and only go to fancy restaurants to say in the end that it is cheap and good.
Don't fall for that. Be a proper tourist and avoid the &quot;Torre de Belem snowball&quot; at all costs. I have only seen snow 2 times in my life and it was not in Lisbon :D</p>
<p><img src="/images/belem_snowball.jpg" alt="Snowing in Lisbon?" /></p>
<p>In Portugal we always seat to have lunch and dinner. We don't eat walking. Traditionally everyone takes at least an hour to have lunch. It is kind of a big deal. People here are very proud of their food. There are many categories of places to eat but locals range them between &quot;fancy restaurant&quot; and &quot;fast-food joint&quot;. Somewhere between these two lies our honorable <em>&quot;tasca&quot;</em> (tavern &lt;= <em>tasca</em> &lt;= simple restaurant). A glorified tavern with a very peculiar set of skills, namely: very good and inexpensive local food.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>In a <em>tasca</em> you can expect at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No cameras looking over you, the balcony or the employers * Never trust a business that tracks you and/or doesn't trust their own people</li>
<li>Open kitchen * Take a peek through the open window inside the kitchen and say hi to the cook</li>
<li>Freshly peeled hand-cut fried potatos * For your pleasure</li>
<li>Pressured wine * We split wine into two major groups: white/red and then inside this group mature/green (or is it the other way around?). Try them all! :)</li>
<li>A balcony if you are just warming your stomach * Yes, we sometimes eat standing at the balcony if it is something really fast</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-the-heart-of-lisbon">In the heart of Lisbon</h2>
<p>Here are 4 <em>tascas</em> that I can think from the top of my head and which I recommend in the touristic area of the city. Don't expect to see &quot;hackers&quot; as in computer wizards in them but typical portuguese folks eating. Chose the one near you when you get hungry.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to keep in mind</h3>
<p>The main reason you step inside a <em>tasca</em> is the food. The second main reason is also the food. The list of reasons is long and every item of the list is food.
At the end of the list, down in the footer in a small font are lots of little details that you happen to notice when you are a regular client. These details are infinite and a new one pops out every time you step inside a <em>tasca</em>.</p>
<p>During lunch hour these are very busy places. The waiters are typically running and rushing while being seriously professional. They are in a no-bullshit mode, they know you want to eat and they know you will love the food.</p>
<p>The kitchen can close outside of eating hours and only small meals are served.</p>
<p>They are somewhat noisy and you can expect to see people screaming if there is a football match going on.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-eat">What to eat</h3>
<p>Dishes are more or less the same in most <em>tascas</em>. Try these.</p>
<p><strong>Starter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Croquete (meat roll)</li>
<li>Chamuça (triangle with curry chicken)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Caldo Verde (kale soup)</li>
<li>Sopa de legumes (vegetables soup)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polvo à lagareiro (octopus with olive oil)</li>
<li>Peixe espada (swordfish)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secretos de porco (pork)</li>
<li>Bife à casa (steak)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drink</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beer</li>
<li>Jar of wine (ask for the pressured white wine if you want the full experience)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dessert</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arroz doce (sweet rice)</li>
<li>Café (ask for an extra <em>bagaço</em> if you want the full experience) * <img src="/images/bagaco.jpg" alt="Café and bagaço" /></li>
</ul>
<p>If you just want a snack or something other than a full-meal, then try out our &quot;Bifana&quot;. A steak sandwich. Goes well with beer.</p>
<h2 id="intro-to-portuguese-pastery">Intro to Portuguese pastery</h2>
<p>Our pastery is a bit different from the european cakes (because we never saw ourselves as a part of europe until +-40 years ago).
We have mostly french influences and also things from all over the world but to keep it short you can generally find fresh original cakes mostly made with sweet egg yolk. We put egg yolk in most of our cake recipes. I have heard several explanations for this, the most convincing one for me is that in convents nuns used the egg light to iron and starch the church clothes, then to avoid wasting the yolk they invented all of these different cakes that you can see in most cafes.</p>
<p>Our pastery shifts radically in some seasons, we have a whole range of cakes and snacks that are only done in christmas and some in easter.</p>
<p>You can find some brazillian pastery, which are heavy in condensed milk (sugar + milk cooked under pressure) and some variations of these with our traditional egg yolk. Just try whatever pops your eye :)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Explore Lisbon, it has many secrets and hidden gems. Our ways might seem a bit strange, clumsy and hard to get into at first, but peeking through the sweet spots can reveal a humble, seasoned and balanced culture (with earned scars of fighting hard against slavery, discrimination, inequality and dictatorship/power surges). If you are here next week for the WebSummit lets hang out and have a drink :) <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/posts/about/">Here is my contact at the bottom</a>. Take a look at why I think <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/posts/lisbon-as-an-inspiration-for-my-project/">Lisbon is an inspiration</a> for my project.</p>

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/startupvoucher.jpg\" alt=\"StartUp Voucher ad, it reads: &quot;What if your idea could turn into a company ?&quot;\" /></p>\n<p>In April 2016 I quit from the startup I was working to finally do a personal project. Back then the questions everyone asked me were mostly about money <em>&quot;How are you going to live ?&quot;</em>.\nEven though rent prices in Lisbon have been skyrocketing due to tourism increase and the coming of WebSummit I always had a frugal economical lifestyle. I don't have loans, I don't have &quot;luxuries&quot; and I can keep my monthly spendings to what some people view as an heroically low value.\nLooking back it was somewhat natural that when a set of conditions met I thought: &quot;it's now or never&quot;.</p>\n<p>I spent some months wondering about what kind of project to do. I knew I wanted something ambitious but I got easily lost in the objectives and purpose of the project. With time I realized that the money I had saved was not going to allow me to survive long enough to do a first version of the product and release it in the market.\nThat made me start looking around for investment, preferably some that did not imply selling part of the company (lost fund). That was when I found about StartUp Voucher.</p>\n<p>Very briefly, StartUp Voucher is a community fund from the European Union that is run by the Portuguese Gov. with the purpose of helping out companies in &quot;idea stage&quot;. Pragmatically this means I get 690EUR/month for 12 months plus the help of an incubator and a mentor.</p>\n<p>This funding is particularly targeted for ideas outside of the most developed areas of the country. In spite of currently living in Lisbon I was born and raised in Alenquer, where my family still resides. To apply for this fund I made the headquarters of my project there, a place I love and visit on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>To further enhance my application I read through the whole 100 page <a href=\"https://www.portugal2020.pt/Portal2020/Media/Default/Docs/EstrategiasEInteligente/EREI%20Centro.pdf\">&quot;Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation&quot; report (RIS3)</a> for my region. That report made me notice that a software tool for grid based drawings could have a lot of impact in several practical applications for the exporting industries in the Center of Portugal. Like ceramics, textiles and creative industries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\"><img src=\"https://gridgenerator.com/img/logo/grid_generator_logo.png\" alt=\"The logo\" /></a></p>\n<p>When Lisbon was boiling with WebSummit 2016 I was working full-time to apply to this fund. It took me a few weeks and in December I finally finished the application and sent it. After a some months I got the news that my project was one of the 245 chosen to be on the StartUp Voucher. Since around May 2017 that I have been getting 690EUR each month and working in full force on this project.</p>\n<p>During this time I have been using their support to fine-tune the project in many ways and prepare myself for the first steps on the market. WebSummit is also being promoted by the StartUp Voucher who encourages all tech startups to try to attend.</p>\n<p>Right now I have a working demo that have been using with some friends and potential users and I am planning to start looking for partnerships in early 2018.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/\">In this link</a> I explain why I decided to go to the WebSummit this year.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/inside_coches2.jpg\" alt=\"He talked to us in the old coach museum\" /></p>\n<p>A few days ago I got an e-mail from the presidency inviting me to go to an event with the president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. This came within the WebSummit context, he wanted to be personally with some of the portuguese startups that are going to attend the WebSummit next week.</p>\n<p>This event would take place in the old National Coach Museum in the near future: today.</p>\n<p>I guess that I got it because of my participation on the &quot;Road2WebSummit&quot; series of events that I was selected to be part of. Road2WebSummit is focused in coaching (pun intended) startups so they can be well prepared for the WebSummit. It tries to fill the gap of our lack of an official &quot;entrepreneur&quot; culture, although we do have a lot of background at being unofficially entrepreneurs as it comes attached to being a poor country in a rich continent. Now we just need to know how to capitalize on that and channel it through proper &quot;startupian&quot; gymnastics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/coches.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance\" /></p>\n<p>The invitation added that the dresscode was a &quot;dark suit&quot;. That was a problem for me since I don't have any suits and did not intend to buy or loan one. I decided to dress somewhat nicely with what I had around without leaning too much towards informality.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/suits.jpg\" alt=\"Suits everywhere\" /></p>\n<p>Almost everyone suited-up for the event, which let me feeling a bit out of place initially, but that all went away once inside.</p>\n<p>The museum is amazing! I had never been there and kind of regret it since they moved to the new &quot;modern&quot; place next door and closed this one (now labeled the &quot;old&quot; one).</p>\n<p>There was still some old coaches around and the ceiling decoration is still beautiful as people always told me it was. At the end they placed chairs for everyone to sit for the speech.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/inside_coches.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance\" /></p>\n<p>The president arrived after a few minutes. He talked for a small bit, introduced the economy minister and the websummit people. He is known for his improvisation skills and for the hability to charismatically make quick decisions. After all the personalities had spoken he then passed the word to the startups. Whoever wanted to speak could introduce themselves and their company/ideia to everyone else.</p>\n<p>Here is the video of his speech (he translates from portuguese to english as he goes).</p>\n<video src=\"http://media.presidencia.pt/videos/mrs2017/PRMRS_171102_V01_FHD.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls />\n<p>About 90 people talked. That was the number they said, personally I did not count and unfortunately after a while my brain was not able to process any more &quot;ideas&quot; or startup names. I was spilling buzzwords through my ears. I think the winner buzzwords were &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;Machine Learning&quot;, &quot;Disruptive&quot;, &quot;App&quot;, &quot;Intelligent&quot;, &quot;Deep learning&quot;, &quot;3D Printer&quot; and some others I can't recall.</p>\n<p>Near the end we took a group picture, and before everyone left they gave some drinks and <em>pasteis de belém</em> while Marcelo was being invaded by people taking selfies with him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/marcelo2.png\" alt=\"Me, the guy with no suit near the camers, with a blue circle. Marcelo, the president, at front with a red circle\" /></p>\n<p>Overall it was a fun event I even met an ex-teacher from my university that is now trying to work out an idea to increase bike usage in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>I hope another opportunity like this happens soon, maybe then I can also take a selfie with the Prez. :D</p>\n<p>Meanwhile checkout how <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/\">I got to participate</a> in the StartUp Portugal events. If you are here for the WebSummit don't be fooled and <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/\">read my recommendations for places to eat</a> in the touristic area.</p>\n",
