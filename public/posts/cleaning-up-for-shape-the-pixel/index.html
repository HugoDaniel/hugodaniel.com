		<p>Moving from Grid Generator into the first version of <em>Shape The Pixel</em> is going to involve the effort of cleaning and pruning the parts that are slightly outside of its intended focus of drawing shapes.</p>
<p>This implies product changes that will propagate into technical decisions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-away">What is going away?</h2>
<p>Things that were done in Grid Generator and that are going to be removed in <em>Shape The Pixel</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login/Register (Login with e-mail and social networks)</li>
<li>Payments (Payment logic and Braintree integration)</li>
<li>Business Logic (&quot;when to allow a customer to do what?&quot; - in <em>Shape The Pixel</em> there are no customers, the app always does everything)</li>
<li>Billing (Invoices and Chargebee integration)</li>
<li>Most UI components (all JSX is going away and it is going to be done with plain HTML and Web Components)</li>
<li>Developer dependencies (the Grid Generator frontend code only had two dependencies, both are going away: inferno and xxhashjs - others might come in)</li>
<li>Split repositories (db code, auth server code, video generator, and frontend code)</li>
<li>Most WebWorkers are going to be removed for the sake of simplicity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-going-to-be-new">What is going to be new?</h2>
<p>Things that are going to be new in <em>Shape The Pixel</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cliddy (an assistant)</li>
<li>UI (redone and centered on Cliddy)</li>
<li>Shape/Grid drawing mode (new UI with a new logic that sits closer to the creative process)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-more-things-change">The more things change...</h2>
<p>Most things will remain the same, which means these will still work or will only carry small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite grid</li>
<li>Shape - the customizable &quot;pixels&quot; editor</li>
<li>Replay your work</li>
<li>MP4 export</li>
<li>Share your work with a link</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Also, expect a couple of surprises on top of these to be announced here on this blog. Alongside a couple of posts detailing some of these points a bit more.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">

</div>
<p>This is part of a new approach to a drawing tool that is going to be called <em>Shape The Pixel</em>.
