		<p><img src="/images/inside_coches2.jpg" alt="He talked to us in the old coach museum" /></p>
<p>A few days ago I got an e-mail from the presidency inviting me to go to an event with the president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. This came within the WebSummit context, he wanted to be personally with some of the portuguese startups that are going to attend the WebSummit next week.</p>
<p>This event would take place in the old National Coach Museum in the near future: today.</p>
<p>I guess that I got it because of my participation on the &quot;Road2WebSummit&quot; series of events that I was selected to be part of. Road2WebSummit is focused in coaching (pun intended) startups so they can be well prepared for the WebSummit. It tries to fill the gap of our lack of an official &quot;entrepreneur&quot; culture, although we do have a lot of background at being unofficially entrepreneurs as it comes attached to being a poor country in a rich continent. Now we just need to know how to capitalize on that and channel it through proper &quot;startupian&quot; gymnastics.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coches.jpg" alt="The entrance" /></p>
<p>The invitation added that the dresscode was a &quot;dark suit&quot;. That was a problem for me since I don't have any suits and did not intend to buy or loan one. I decided to dress somewhat nicely with what I had around without leaning too much towards informality.</p>
<p><img src="/images/suits.jpg" alt="Suits everywhere" /></p>
<p>Almost everyone suited-up for the event, which let me feeling a bit out of place initially, but that all went away once inside.</p>
<p>The museum is amazing! I had never been there and kind of regret it since they moved to the new &quot;modern&quot; place next door and closed this one (now labeled the &quot;old&quot; one).</p>
<p>There was still some old coaches around and the ceiling decoration is still beautiful as people always told me it was. At the end they placed chairs for everyone to sit for the speech.</p>
<p><img src="/images/inside_coches.jpg" alt="The entrance" /></p>
<p>The president arrived after a few minutes. He talked for a small bit, introduced the economy minister and the websummit people. He is known for his improvisation skills and for the hability to charismatically make quick decisions. After all the personalities had spoken he then passed the word to the startups. Whoever wanted to speak could introduce themselves and their company/ideia to everyone else.</p>
<p>Here is the video of his speech (he translates from portuguese to english as he goes).</p>
<video src="http://media.presidencia.pt/videos/mrs2017/PRMRS_171102_V01_FHD.mp4" width="100%" controls />
<p>About 90 people talked. That was the number they said, personally I did not count and unfortunately after a while my brain was not able to process any more &quot;ideas&quot; or startup names. I was spilling buzzwords through my ears. I think the winner buzzwords were &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;Machine Learning&quot;, &quot;Disruptive&quot;, &quot;App&quot;, &quot;Intelligent&quot;, &quot;Deep learning&quot;, &quot;3D Printer&quot; and some others I can't recall.</p>
<p>Near the end we took a group picture, and before everyone left they gave some drinks and <em>pasteis de belém</em> while Marcelo was being invaded by people taking selfies with him.</p>
<p><img src="/images/marcelo2.png" alt="Me, the guy with no suit near the camers, with a blue circle. Marcelo, the president, at front with a red circle" /></p>
<p>Overall it was a fun event I even met an ex-teacher from my university that is now trying to work out an idea to increase bike usage in Lisbon.</p>
<p>I hope another opportunity like this happens soon, maybe then I can also take a selfie with the Prez. :D</p>
<p>Meanwhile checkout how <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/">I got to participate</a> in the StartUp Portugal events.

We do have a strong background of using things beyond their intended purpose (we call it &quot;desenrascanço&quot; and it is a basic trait of being born in the culture that has sprung here for centuries).</p>\n<p>As is this post is intended for tourists looking for a typical experience.</p>\n<p>If you are visiting Lisbon chances are that you will spend your time around the most touristic areas of the city. In this post I want to share with you some places and dishes that we love and are generally ignored by tourists. I don't pretend to be Anthony Bourdain or any of those youtubers that don't respect what they are eating and only go to fancy restaurants to say in the end that it is cheap and good.\nDon't fall for that. Be a proper tourist and avoid the &quot;Torre de Belem snowball&quot; at all costs. I have only seen snow 2 times in my life and it was not in Lisbon :D</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/belem_snowball.jpg\" alt=\"Snowing in Lisbon?\" /></p>\n<p>In Portugal we always seat to have lunch and dinner. We don't eat walking. Traditionally everyone takes at least an hour to have lunch. It is kind of a big deal. People here are very proud of their food. There are many categories of places to eat but locals range them between &quot;fancy restaurant&quot; and &quot;fast-food joint&quot;. Somewhere between these two lies our honorable <em>&quot;tasca&quot;</em> (tavern &lt;= <em>tasca</em> &lt;= simple restaurant). A glorified tavern with a very peculiar set of skills, namely: very good and inexpensive local food.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to expect</h2>\n<p>In a <em>tasca</em> you can expect at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No cameras looking over you, the balcony or the employers * Never trust a business that tracks you and/or doesn't trust their own people</li>\n<li>Open kitchen * Take a peek through the open window inside the kitchen and say hi to the cook</li>\n<li>Freshly peeled hand-cut fried potatos * For your pleasure</li>\n<li>Pressured wine * We split wine into two major groups: white/red and then inside this group mature/green (or is it the other way around?). Try them all! :)</li>\n<li>A balcony if you are just warming your stomach * Yes, we sometimes eat standing at the balcony if it is something really fast</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-heart-of-lisbon\">In the heart of Lisbon</h2>\n<p>Here are 4 <em>tascas</em> that I can think from the top of my head and which I recommend in the touristic area of the city. Don't expect to see &quot;hackers&quot; as in computer wizards in them but typical portuguese folks eating. Chose the one near you when you get hungry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Casa+Das+Bifanas/@38.7141819,-9.1400812,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd1933877a14a101:0x58658df29b0791b0!8m2!3d38.7141769!4d-9.1378849\">&quot;Casa das Bifanas&quot; in Rossio</a> - <img src=\"/images/bifanas.jpg\" alt=\"Formely known as &quot;The king of Bifanas&quot;\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Popular+Do+Capelo/@38.7098328,-9.1408684,20z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0xd1933877a14a101:0x58658df29b0791b0!2sCasa+Das+Bifanas!8m2!3d38.7141769!4d-9.1378849!3m4!1s0xd19347ecf1cf809:0xb3685b3298796599!8m2!3d38.7097915!4d-9.1406129\">&quot;Popular do Capelo&quot; in Chiado</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.pt/maps/place/O+Trevo/@38.7116017,-9.1461413,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd19347fa8fe09bd:0xd6fe73efee2fb6fc!8m2!3d38.710865!4d-9.1430943\">&quot;O Trevo&quot; in Pc.

The second main reason is also the food. The list of reasons is long and every item of the list is food.\nAt the end of the list, down in the footer in a small font are lots of little details that you happen to notice when you are a regular client. These details are infinite and a new one pops out every time you step inside a <em>tasca</em>.</p>\n<p>During lunch hour these are very busy places. The waiters are typically running and rushing while being seriously professional. They are in a no-bullshit mode, they know you want to eat and they know you will love the food.</p>\n<p>The kitchen can close outside of eating hours and only small meals are served.</p>\n<p>They are somewhat noisy and you can expect to see people screaming if there is a football match going on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-to-eat\">What to eat</h3>\n<p>Dishes are more or less the same in most <em>tascas</em>. Try these.</p>\n<p><strong>Starter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Croquete (meat roll)</li>\n<li>Chamuça (triangle with curry chicken)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Soup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caldo Verde (kale soup)</li>\n<li>Sopa de legumes (vegetables soup)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fish</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polvo à lagareiro (octopus with olive oil)</li>\n<li>Peixe espada (swordfish)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Meat</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secretos de porco (pork)</li>\n<li>Bife à casa (steak)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drink</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beer</li>\n<li>Jar of wine (ask for the pressured white wine if you want the full experience)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dessert</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arroz doce (sweet rice)</li>\n<li>Café (ask for an extra <em>bagaço</em> if you want the full experience) * <img src=\"/images/bagaco.jpg\" alt=\"Café and bagaço\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you just want a snack or something other than a full-meal, then try out our &quot;Bifana&quot;. A steak sandwich. Goes well with beer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intro-to-portuguese-pastery\">Intro to Portuguese pastery</h2>\n<p>Our pastery is a bit different from the european cakes (because we never saw ourselves as a part of europe until +-40 years ago).\nWe have mostly french influences and also things from all over the world but to keep it short you can generally find fresh original cakes mostly made with sweet egg yolk. We put egg yolk in most of our cake recipes. I have heard several explanations for this, the most convincing one for me is that in convents nuns used the egg light to iron and starch the church clothes, then to avoid wasting the yolk they invented all of these different cakes that you can see in most cafes.</p>\n<p>Our pastery shifts radically in some seasons, we have a whole range of cakes and snacks that are only done in christmas and some in easter.</p>\n<p>You can find some brazillian pastery, which are heavy in condensed milk (sugar + milk cooked under pressure) and some variations of these with our traditional egg yolk. Just try whatever pops your eye :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Explore Lisbon, it has many secrets and hidden gems. Our ways might seem a bit strange, clumsy and hard to get into at first, but peeking through the sweet spots can reveal a humble, seasoned and balanced culture (with earned scars of fighting hard against slavery, discrimination, inequality and dictatorship/power surges).

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/beato1.jpg\" alt=\"Beato Creative Hub\" /></p>\n<p>About a month ago I was planning my WebSummit approach when I realized that I had never been to such an event. Much less have a stand of my project there.</p>\n<p>That was when I started searching for opportunities to be at events. To train and prepare for the WebSummit.</p>\n<p>Back then I got an invitation to participate in the first aniversary of StartUp Portugal, the portuguese state entity that acts upon the development of our entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>\n<p>My immediate decision was to say &quot;yes&quot; and use this oportunity to train the speach/pitch/posture in a faire stand.\nThe event took place in the <a href=\"http://www.startuplisboa.com/hcb\">&quot;beato creative hub&quot;</a>, an old military industrial area that was abandoned for years until they decided to turn it into the next big thing in Lisbon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/beato2.jpg\" alt=\"The bag reads &quot;Military Maintenance&quot;, as this was an old factory related to the portuguese military\" /></p>\n<p>Access wise it is near the river, and although it has a nearby bike path, the entrance is on the inner side, making it difficult to get there on bike or on foot (cars tend to speed and the sidewalks are narrow in that area of the city). The surrounding neighborhood used to be neglected and poor, but now it is thriving with Lisboners looking for different places to hangout due to the tourist pressure present in past common areas of the city (bairro alto, cais do sodré, etc...).</p>\n<p>That day (4th of October) I arrived a bit earlier than expected to setup my stand and after it I drank a beer to chill out while making my first contacts with the other stands as they arrived.</p>\n<p>The whole thing was novelty to me, I was there with <a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\">Grid Generator</a>, the bootstrapped project I've been working on, and things proceeded in three waves during the day:</p>\n<h2 id=\"wave-1-lots-of-people-in-suits\">Wave 1: Lots of people in suits</h2>\n<p>After a while lots of people in suits showed up. Most of these were just walking around while keeping a safe distance from the stands. Enough not to get approached by any of us there standing.\nSince I was there to take the most of it, I grabed a few flyers and actively went to them to talk about my amazing project.</p>\n<p>To my shock they were not interested in listening to what I had to say. This was not even a problem with my pitch because they turned me down right after I showed up with a smile and said &quot;Hello, can I talk to you about my project ?&quot;. Maybe it is a problem with my face.</p>\n<p>If they were not there for the startups and the people working on them then what were they there for ?</p>\n<p>I decided to deal with it and move along. I guess negative reactions should be expected when going to these events with an active posture (seeking people to speak, instead of waiting for them to speak with you).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/me_beato.jpg\" alt=\"Me in my stand\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"wave-2-nobody\">Wave 2: Nobody</h2>\n<p>The event then had some talks. Unfortunately they were scheduled to happen in a different building than the one we were in. So suddenly everybody left and disappeared from sight. A few important politicians showed up to talk (I saw them at a glimpse) and we were left alone: should I leave my stand unattended ? I decided to stay and hold my ground just in case somebody showed up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/talks_beato.jpg\" alt=\"Talks happening in another pavillion\" /></p>\n<p>During this time my motivation was going down and approaching a local minimum for that day. <em>&quot;I see... this is mostly a political event.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>That was when I met Pedro from <a href=\"http://othersigns.pt/\">othersigns.pt</a>. He had decided to check out the projects while we were mostly empty. I pitched him when he interrupted and decided to criticise me about my pitch approach:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Why are you talking about your project like it is targeted for the design industry ? I can clearly see it is not, yet you talk about it like it is&quot;</em></p>\n<p>We talked. One hour later he had convinced me to look at it from a different angle and try to push the real innovative things about my project and sell it as a design tool for non-designers. Something targeted for the creative crowd that needs to do some design but don't know/want to work with complex pro tools like the ones professional designers use.</p>\n<p>Lots of different possibilities and approaches for <a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\">Grid Generator</a> came into conversation. It was fun and made the event worthwhile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wave-3-some-important-people\">Wave 3: Some important people</h2>\n<p>After the talks ended in the other pavillion a hoard of scouts in suits approached our stands and told the people next to me, in an important tone, that they would have to speak with the secretary of state for the industry.\nIt happenened. She talked to them, took some photos, and promptly decided to ignore most of us in the other stands, talking only to a select few. The other politicians didn't bother to show up.</p>\n<p>Startups were apparently the boring part in this startup event. <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/meeting-the-president/\">Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, yesterday,</a> was kind enough to give voice to anyone who wanted to speak.</p>\n<p>After this I went out. Grabbed a slice of the aniversary cake that they were eating outside (even the cake was outside the stands area), and had another beer while meditating on what had happened. After this I left to dance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DYElqcREXc\">Kizomba</a> in another part of the city.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I decided to participate in this event in order to train for our WebSummit stand. Overall it was a fun experience albeit the first of its kind I had. I am not sure I would want to repeat it again if given the chance.</p>\n<p>It definetely helped me learn a few things about being in a stand and craft a more prepared approach for the bigger event that is the WebSummit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/aniv1.jpg\" alt=\"Me at the first aniversay of StarUp Portugal, shortly after the event ended\" /></p>\n<p>Here is a quick list of things this helped me learn about being in a stand, some of these are pretty obvious but still worth to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take an active approach (approach and talk to people). I talked to more people than any of the other stands there.</li>\n<li>Don't grudge if people don't want to talk to you (it is normal)</li>\n<li>Your product demo is not the most important part. People will not get to it if your pitch is not convincing.</li>\n<li>Don't focus on pitching features. Pitch a story instead. It grabs attention better.</li>\n<li>Keep a log of e-mails and reach them a few days later (ask people for their e-mails and not the other way around: don't give your e-mail expecting to be contacted: you won't be).</li>\n<li>Eye-candy is important, the stands with the better visual looks got most of the attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope this helps and see you at the WebSummit next week <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/lisbon-as-an-inspiration-for-my-project/\">in Lisbon</a>, also take a look at some cool <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.com/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/\">places to eat in the touristic area of Lisbon</a> :)</p>\n",
