		<p>Two months have passed since i quit my job with the plan of taking some time to develop a few ideas that have outgrown me enough to earn the respect of a full-time dedication.</p>
<p>This &quot;Bootstrapping&quot; post is the first in a series of posts about a quest to a sustainable monthly income.</p>
<p>To start i am going to do a painting web application. A simple web app to paint points in a canvas. I call it &quot;paint.pt&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="1st-week">1st Week</h2>
<p>The week went about fine, in the first days i learned a bit more about JavaScript in order to understand if a framework would be necessary for paint.pt.</p>
<p>After some thinking, a bit of research and some rough implementations of what i thought would be the corner cases of it, i decided to pass the oportunity to use pure JavaScript and use react instead.</p>
<p>By the time of this writing i am living in the year 2016. That means the rest of the week was spent configuring a react/redux/immutable/webpack/mocha/selenium/babel/flow/eslint boilerplate repository for it.</p>
<p>By the end of the week i realized that the sun was shining outside and so i went for a walk in Lisbon to read a few chapters of the git book.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>

Most of the fun happens during the night.</p>\n<p>In order to carry 3 extra days of holidays for the next week (this way i would be able to recover from sunday night) i decided to work for 7 days on my 2nd week (through the weekend).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/sardinha.jpg\" alt=\"Lisbon party sardine 2016\" title=\"Uma sardinha das que se comem com os olhos\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"2nd-week\">2nd Week</h2>\n<p>In the beginning of the week i opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/paintpoint/paintpt/issues/2\">ticket</a> to render a simple square grid on the canvas. This was supposed to be a simple task but it took me a bit to complete.</p>\n<p>What would be a good way to render to canvas using react/redux ?</p>\n<p>What would be a good data type for the paint app ?</p>\n<p>How would it interact with the canvas and the react/redux logic ?</p>\n<p>These questions made me start a new sub-project that i named &quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/HugoDaniel/redux-canvas\">redux-canvas</a>&quot;. It is yet another way to draw on the canvas using react/redux.</p>\n<p>By the end of the week (sunday, 12) i did not yet had it finished or published, but stay tuned (subscribe please) because a more thorough blog post about all of this is on the way.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to subscribe and checkout the other &quot;bootstrapping&quot; posts: <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/bootstrapping1/\">Bootstrapping 1</a>, <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/bootstrapping3/\">Boostrapping 3</a> and <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/bootstrapping4/\">Bootstrapping 4</a>.</p>\n",
