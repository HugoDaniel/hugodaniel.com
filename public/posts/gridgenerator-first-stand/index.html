<p>About a month ago I was planning my WebSummit approach when I realized that I had never been to such an event. Much less have a stand of my project there.</p>
<p>That was when I started searching for opportunities to be at events. To train and prepare for the WebSummit.</p>
<p>Back then I got an invitation to participate in the first aniversary of StartUp Portugal, the portuguese state entity that acts upon the development of our entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
<p>My immediate decision was to say &quot;yes&quot; and use this oportunity to train the speach/pitch/posture in a faire stand.
The event took place in the <a href="http://www.startuplisboa.com/hcb">&quot;beato creative hub&quot;</a>, an old military industrial area that was abandoned for years until they decided to turn it into the next big thing in Lisbon.</p>
<p><img src="/images/beato2.jpg" alt="The bag reads &quot;Military Maintenance&quot;, as this was an old factory related to the portuguese military" /></p>
<p>Access wise it is near the river, and although it has a nearby bike path, the entrance is on the inner side, making it difficult to get there on bike or on foot (cars tend to speed and the sidewalks are narrow in that area of the city). The surrounding neighborhood used to be neglected and poor, but now it is thriving with Lisboners looking for different places to hangout due to the tourist pressure present in past common areas of the city (bairro alto, cais do sodré, etc...).</p>
<p>That day (4th of October) I arrived a bit earlier than expected to setup my stand and after it I drank a beer to chill out while making my first contacts with the other stands as they arrived.</p>
<p>The whole thing was novelty to me, I was there with <a href="https://gridgenerator.com">Grid Generator</a>, the bootstrapped project I've been working on, and things proceeded in three waves during the day:</p>
<h2 id="wave-1-lots-of-people-in-suits">Wave 1: Lots of people in suits</h2>
<p>After a while lots of people in suits showed up. Most of these were just walking around while keeping a safe distance from the stands. Enough not to get approached by any of us there standing.
Since I was there to take the most of it, I grabed a few flyers and actively went to them to talk about my amazing project.</p>
<p>To my shock they were not interested in listening to what I had to say. This was not even a problem with my pitch because they turned me down right after I showed up with a smile and said &quot;Hello, can I talk to you about my project ?&quot;. Maybe it is a problem with my face.</p>
<p>If they were not there for the startups and the people working on them then what were they there for ?</p>
<p>I decided to deal with it and move along. I guess negative reactions should be expected when going to these events with an active posture (seeking people to speak, instead of waiting for them to speak with you).</p>
<p><img src="/images/me_beato.jpg" alt="Me in my stand" /></p>
<h2 id="wave-2-nobody">Wave 2: Nobody</h2>
<p>The event then had some talks. Unfortunately they were scheduled to happen in a different building than the one we were in. So suddenly everybody left and disappeared from sight. A few important politicians showed up to talk (I saw them at a glimpse) and we were left alone: should I leave my stand unattended ? I decided to stay and hold my ground just in case somebody showed up.</p>
<p><img src="/images/talks_beato.jpg" alt="Talks happening in another pavillion" /></p>
<p>During this time my motivation was going down and approaching a local minimum for that day. <em>&quot;I see... this is mostly a political event.&quot;</em></p>
<p>That was when I met Pedro from <a href="http://othersigns.pt/">othersigns.pt</a>. He had decided to check out the projects while we were mostly empty. I pitched him when he interrupted and decided to criticise me about my pitch approach:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Why are you talking about your project like it is targeted for the design industry ? I can clearly see it is not, yet you talk about it like it is&quot;</em></p>
<p>We talked. One hour later he had convinced me to look at it from a different angle and try to push the real innovative things about my project and sell it as a design tool for non-designers. Something targeted for the creative crowd that needs to do some design but don't know/want to work with complex pro tools like the ones professional designers use.</p>
<p>Lots of different possibilities and approaches for <a href="https://gridgenerator.com">Grid Generator</a> came into conversation. It was fun and made the event worthwhile.</p>
<h2 id="wave-3-some-important-people">Wave 3: Some important people</h2>
<p>After the talks ended in the other pavillion a hoard of scouts in suits approached our stands and told the people next to me, in an important tone, that they would have to speak with the secretary of state for the industry.
It happenened. She talked to them, took some photos, and promptly decided to ignore most of us in the other stands, talking only to a select few. The other politicians didn't bother to show up.</p>
<p>Startups were apparently the boring part in this startup event. <a href="https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/meeting-the-president/">Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, yesterday,</a> was kind enough to give voice to anyone who wanted to speak.</p>
<p>After this I went out. Grabbed a slice of the aniversary cake that they were eating outside (even the cake was outside the stands area), and had another beer while meditating on what had happened. After this I left to dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DYElqcREXc">Kizomba</a> in another part of the city.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I decided to participate in this event in order to train for our WebSummit stand. Overall it was a fun experience albeit the first of its kind I had. I am not sure I would want to repeat it again if given the chance.</p>
<p>It definetely helped me learn a few things about being in a stand and craft a more prepared approach for the bigger event that is the WebSummit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aniv1.jpg" alt="Me at the first aniversay of StarUp Portugal, shortly after the event ended" /></p>
<p>Here is a quick list of things this helped me learn about being in a stand, some of these are pretty obvious but still worth to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take an active approach (approach and talk to people). I talked to more people than any of the other stands there.</li>
<li>Don't grudge if people don't want to talk to you (it is normal)</li>
<li>Your product demo is not the most important part. People will not get to it if your pitch is not convincing.</li>
<li>Don't focus on pitching features. Pitch a story instead. It grabs attention better.</li>
<li>Keep a log of e-mails and reach them a few days later (ask people for their e-mails and not the other way around: don't give your e-mail expecting to be contacted: you won't be).</li>
<li>Eye-candy is important, the stands with the better visual looks got most of the attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps and see you at the WebSummit next week <a href="https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/lisbon-as-an-inspiration-for-my-project/">in Lisbon</a>, also take a look at some cool <a href="https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/">places to eat in the touristic area of Lisbon</a> :)</p>

This came within the WebSummit context, he wanted to be personally with some of the portuguese startups that are going to attend the WebSummit next week.</p>\n<p>This event would take place in the old National Coach Museum in the near future: today.</p>\n<p>I guess that I got it because of my participation on the &quot;Road2WebSummit&quot; series of events that I was selected to be part of. Road2WebSummit is focused in coaching (pun intended) startups so they can be well prepared for the WebSummit. It tries to fill the gap of our lack of an official &quot;entrepreneur&quot; culture, although we do have a lot of background at being unofficially entrepreneurs as it comes attached to being a poor country in a rich continent. Now we just need to know how to capitalize on that and channel it through proper &quot;startupian&quot; gymnastics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/coches.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance\" /></p>\n<p>The invitation added that the dresscode was a &quot;dark suit&quot;. That was a problem for me since I don't have any suits and did not intend to buy or loan one. I decided to dress somewhat nicely with what I had around without leaning too much towards informality.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/suits.jpg\" alt=\"Suits everywhere\" /></p>\n<p>Almost everyone suited-up for the event, which let me feeling a bit out of place initially, but that all went away once inside.</p>\n<p>The museum is amazing! I had never been there and kind of regret it since they moved to the new &quot;modern&quot; place next door and closed this one (now labeled the &quot;old&quot; one).</p>\n<p>There was still some old coaches around and the ceiling decoration is still beautiful as people always told me it was. At the end they placed chairs for everyone to sit for the speech.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/inside_coches.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance\" /></p>\n<p>The president arrived after a few minutes. He talked for a small bit, introduced the economy minister and the websummit people. He is known for his improvisation skills and for the hability to charismatically make quick decisions. After all the personalities had spoken he then passed the word to the startups. Whoever wanted to speak could introduce themselves and their company/ideia to everyone else.</p>\n<p>Here is the video of his speech (he translates from portuguese to english as he goes).</p>\n<video src=\"http://media.presidencia.pt/videos/mrs2017/PRMRS_171102_V01_FHD.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls />\n<p>About 90 people talked. That was the number they said, personally I did not count and unfortunately after a while my brain was not able to process any more &quot;ideas&quot; or startup names. I was spilling buzzwords through my ears. I think the winner buzzwords were &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;Machine Learning&quot;, &quot;Disruptive&quot;, &quot;App&quot;, &quot;Intelligent&quot;, &quot;Deep learning&quot;, &quot;3D Printer&quot; and some others I can't recall.</p>\n<p>Near the end we took a group picture, and before everyone left they gave some drinks and <em>pasteis de belém</em> while Marcelo was being invaded by people taking selfies with him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/marcelo2.png\" alt=\"Me, the guy with no suit near the camers, with a blue circle. Marcelo, the president, at front with a red circle\" /></p>\n<p>Overall it was a fun event I even met an ex-teacher from my university that is now trying to work out an idea to increase bike usage in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>I hope another opportunity like this happens soon, maybe then I can also take a selfie with the Prez. :D</p>\n<p>Meanwhile checkout how <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/first-funding-as-a-bootstrapper-in-portugal/\">I got to participate</a> in the StartUp Portugal events. If you are here for the WebSummit don't be fooled and <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/where-do-local-hackers-eat-in-lisbon/\">read my recommendations for places to eat</a> in the touristic area.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/abertura02.jpg\" alt=\"Paddy Cosgrave taking a selfie on the Center Stage during the opening night\" /></p>\n<p>WebSummit first day came with a mix of up and downs sprinkled with the duality of having the desire to scream with euphoria versus admiting that the event is nothing special to avoid stressing about it.</p>\n<p>This week I was contacted by their team to go up on the main stage with some of the startups that were present in last week event with the President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. That gave me cold sweats even though I knew it was nothing special. The idea was just to go on stage when they called for us and be there representing our startup scene.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, I went to the venue with high hopes of doing my registration and never think about WebSummit until the main stage opening night thing. Unfortunately they told me that registration would only happen after 12h, which made me go back home to spend the rest of the day printing and cutting flyers and cards to hopefully distribute to people at the event.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura05.jpg\" alt=\"Entrepreneurs in the opening night, on the left I didn't get the contact, on the right is Dinara Rakhimbaeva of ExpoChat\" /></p>\n<p>Later at night, I had the meeting point with the WebSummit team nearby the pavillion where the opening night was going to happen. They routed all of us through a tunnel that gave access to the spectators area of the pavillion. From the speakers that attended I really enjoyed Margrethe Vestager, the european comissioner for competition, she spoke about markets and taxes to tech companies. I also liked a lot of the speech that António Guterres gave, the former prime-minister of Portugal and now secretary-general of the United Nations who spoke about the biggest difficulty of our generation: climate change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura04.jpg\" alt=\"António Costa waiting to press the button\" /></p>\n<p>The cerimony was closed with the current prime-minister of Portugal, António Costa, and the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, who both pressed in a button that made a lot of confettis cannons explode. Before that they invited the portuguese startups the stage, where I was included. I used the chance to take a few pictures and wave at Guterres and Margrethe when by chance they looked at me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura03.jpg\" alt=\"WebSummit starting\" /></p>\n",
