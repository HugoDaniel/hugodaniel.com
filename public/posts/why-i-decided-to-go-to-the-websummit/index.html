<p>Personally I find it impossible to answer this question. I feel that it was not me who actually took the decision to go to the WebSummit. Even though I did.</p>
<p>It all hapened through a sequence of chained events that led me to have to decide to buy a discounted alpha ticket to go there.</p>
<p>At first the WebSummit has two big &quot;no&quot;'s: the price and if you can actually get something useful from it. I can argue that there is some pressure to go when you have the whole city talking about this conference and you know quite a few people that are going there. How can you miss the even where supposedly everything is hapenning ?</p>

<p><a href="https://gridgenerator.com">My project is a web app to help people work their graphical ideas</a> without having to learn pro software so that they can use these ideas in their daily lives. Technically it is a grid where each element has itself a customized grid inside. Besides this it also has a cool way to help select colors that match and work well with each other.
I have not yet released it, so I don't have any market data to show off. I am not looking for investment for two main reasons: I want to bootstrap it and it currently is in an early stage (almost fully developed but still before market).</p>
<p>I talked beforehand to some people that went to the 2016 edition, and they said that it's a big event, so big that it is confusing to be there. Also most people that go are looking for investment. All these people that I talked to work for some company that paid their tickets, so I had to keep that in mind when considering their opinion (myself being a bootstrapper).</p>
<p>Because of this initially I had decided not to go. Then I talked to my mentor and he insisted that I considered the pros and cons of going and not going.
I then changed my mind into going to the WebSummit because he convinced me that the potential to expand my contact network and talk to people that might be interested in the project was something that at this stage would be very good overall.</p>
<p>Hence the decision to give WebSummit a chance. I applied to their &quot;alpha ticket&quot;, got selected after a quick interview and they sold me a ~520EUR pass available. This was <em>a lot</em> for me to pay. Even considering that I would be getting 3 tickets and a stand there for my project during one day. But I bit the bullet considering that I am living in Lisbon and that I would have no further big expenses.</p>
<p>That was three months ago, meanwhile I have already considered and reconsidered my previous decision, and my current status is still a bit doubtful about the WebSummit as a worthwhile experience for a bootstrapper. I am certainly not going to look for an investment (like most people apparently go) and the real benefits that I think I will obtain are not easily tangible (personal development and enrichment, maybe some hope of having inspirational talks with different minded people).</p>
<p>Maybe in WebSummit I will meet people that can open my mind to other different kinds of funding. Maybe in the future I will do a kickstarter campaign or some other kind of funding project.
Right now I know that at least I get the chance to be in the same place as Al Gore and other great thinkers...</p>

      "content": "<p>Any JavaScript spaghetti worth its salt won't keep track of its objects references or their updates.\nThese are things that happen between the mind of a chef and the ether of a planned portion with lots of defensive copying.\n<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\">Immutable.js</a> aims to reduce these portion sizes to match the ones in fancy restaurants while avoiding ingredients like:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>To try out this new pepper lets open the developer tools in a new tab and sharpen our sour-sweet tooth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/devtools.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Firefox developer tools in console mode.\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-many-calories-has-the-appetizer\">How many calories has the appetizer ?</h2>\n<p>In order to measure the amount of memory that Immutable.js uses by itself lets marinate it in a quick and dirty formula:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the devtools</li>\n<li>Define a simple array with a single item in it and print it to the console\n<ul>\n<li><pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"> let test1 = [1337];\n</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"> console.log(test1);\n</span></code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code></code></pre></li>\n<li>Measure the memory usage (memory tab of the dev tools)</li>\n<li>Load Immutable.js directly into the console (copy pasting its minified source directly into the console)</li>\n<li>Define a simple list with a single item in it and print it to the console\n<ul>\n<li><pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"> let test2 = Immutable.List.of(1337);\n</span><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"> console.log(test2);\n</span></code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code></code></pre></li>\n<li>Measure the memory usage again</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key points are 3. and 6. so lets do it and take a look into the memory info. For these measures I am using Firefox Developer Edition 53.0a2 (2017-03-05) (64-bit) in OSX Sierra.</p>\n<p>After point 3. I have 2.11MB of used memory with the following layout:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>scripts</em>: 37KiB (347 objects)</li>\n<li><em>strings</em>: 362KiB (9685 objects)</li>\n<li><em>objects</em>: 813KiB (11325 objects)</li>\n<li><em>other</em>: 849KiB (18365 objects)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is for nothing but an empty tab with devtools opened after point 3. in the magic formula.</p>\n<p>Now lets load <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/immutable-js/master/dist/immutable.min.js\">Immutable.js raw minification</a> and run the rest of the steps.</p>\n<p>After point 6.  I have 2.53MB of used memory with the following layout:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>scripts</em>: 248KiB (1717 objects)</li>\n<li><em>strings</em>: 384KiB (10252 objects)</li>\n<li><em>objects</em>: 904KiB (12618 objects)</li>\n<li><em>other</em>: 933KiB (19984 objects)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immutable.js makes the memory usage go up from 2.1MB to about 2.5MB.</strong> That's around 0.4MB just to load the minified Immutable.js in memory.</p>\n<p>Lets keep this value as a reference in further tests. I am keeping these memory snapshots also for further reference.</p>\n<p>How can we leverage the juice from these 0.4MB into our secret sauce ?</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-list-of-many-secrets\">A list of many secrets</h2>\n<p>Immutable allows the discerning chef to cook with well defined ingredients. You can define your own data types and use them as immutable everywhere you want to. To do that the Immutable.Record is their provided interface. </p>\n<p>The following code uses it to define a data type for a 2D point, with X and Y coordinates, and then create some points with it.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const Pt = Immutable.Record( { x: 0, y: 0} );\n\nconst pt1 = new Pt(); // uses x: 0, y: 0 by default\nconst pt2 = new Pt({ y: 123 }); // uses x: 0 by default\nconst pt3 = new Pt({ x: 123, y: 321 }); // uses your provided values\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Fast-food junkies could do the same in straight JS with the simpler approach:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">function PtJS(x = 0, y = 0) {\n\tthis.x = x;\n\tthis.y = y;\n}\n\nlet jspt1 = new PtJS();\nlet jspt2 = new PtJS(0, 123);\nlet jspt3 = new PtJS(123, 321);\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Some might even argue that they are not wasting the memory that Immutable is. Master chefs are always looking for opportunities to learn, to study and to teach. </p>\n<p>Now for a simple test, create a list with 10000 of those 2D points and compare memory readings of the Immutable approach with the plain JS approach.</p>\n<p>First the plain JS approach (lets assume the constructor is already created as above).</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">\nlet testArray = [];\nfor(let i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++) {\n  testArray.push(new PtJS());\n}\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>After measuring this in the Memory tab we get 2.92MB in this layout:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>scripts</em>: 228KiB (1692 objects)</li>\n<li><em>strings</em>: 384KiB (10251 objects)</li>\n<li><em>objects</em>: 1MiB (22688 objects)</li>\n<li><em>other</em>: 888KiB (19990 objects)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That seems fair, we get an increase of about 390KiB in comparison to our previous measurement. That should be enough motivation to roll our Chefs Knives suitecase of Persistency and do it in Immutable style to measure it on top of this 2.92MB already in use.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const defaultPt = new Pt();\nconst testLst = Immutable.Repeat(defaultPt, 10000);\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>After measuring this in the Memory tab we get 2.91MB. This is a decrease of about 10KiB from our previous memory usage. How is this possible ? Is the data even there ?</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">testLst.first().x;\n// returns 0\ntestLst.size();\n// returns 10000\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Yep, it's all there. Immutable.js allows you to take good care of your memory, but as with all sharp knifes you need to know how to avoid hurting yourself. Lets dive a bit further to understand what is going on and how to master these data structures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"master-chef-mystery-boxes\">Master Chef Mystery Boxes</h2>\n<p>One common misconception about immutable data structures is that there is a lot of useless copying being done. In fact this is so common that there are even <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable\">JS libraries based on it</a>. Playing with the flavour of common things note the most typical data structure in functional languages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-single-linked-list\">The single linked list.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable-list1.gif\" alt=\"A single linked list with 3 values\" /></p>\n<p>Supposed that this is a immutable list. It is not possible to add, remove or change its values without returning a new version of it.</p>\n<p>Does this mean that we need to copy all of it when we need to put a new value in it ? Not necessarily. We can just create the new list item and make sure its pointer is targeting the beginning of the original list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable-list2.png\" alt=\"Placing a new value in the previous list\" /></p>\n<p>This works because the list is immutable, we know for sure that the original list won't change so <strong>it is possible to reuse its values</strong>, no copying is involved in this.</p>\n<p>As before, our new immutable list is again defined by its first value, which in this new case is our new value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"master-the-simple-cuts-first\">Master the simple cuts first</h3>\n<p>Many operations are possible on our immutable single linked list that leverage the fact that it is an immutable list.</p>\n<p>Operations like <em>head</em> (return the first value in the list) and <em>tail</em> (return all the items in the list except for the first) are almost instantaneous to implement. For <em>head</em> we just return the value of the first item and for <em>tail</em> we just return the first item pointer value (which is an immutable single linked list, in this case, our original 3 value list).</p>\n<h4 id=\"concat\">Concat</h4>\n<p>Joining two lists is one of those simple operations that is worth your time and attention in order to understand it. If we have 2 different immutable lists that we want to join we need to go to the first list and adjust the last pointer of the last item to point to the first item of the second list.</p>\n<p>Here it is in pictures:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_two_lists.png\" alt=\"Joining these two lists\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_two_lists_2.png\" alt=\"We need to make the last item point to the first item of the second list\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_two_lists_3.png\" alt=\"A copy of this element is necessary because we can't just change it to point to the first item of lst2\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_two_lists_4.png\" alt=\"But now we need to make the previous item point to the newly created copy. So a copy of it will also be necessary.\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_two_lists_final.png\" alt=\"That is why to concat two lists a new list is made with a copy of the elements in the first list\" /></p>\n<p>Concat is a heavy operation, it mostly depends on the size of the first list. There are a few tricks to make it faster.</p>\n<p>To keep it simple I am not going to go much more into this and move to the point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-recipe-is-made-of-many-subrecipes\">The best recipe is made of many subrecipes</h2>\n<p>The list holds data. That's why it's called a <em>data</em> structure. Now what if instead of directly putting our data in each list item we could instead just point to the data ? Like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_lazy1.png\" alt=\"List doesn't directly hold the data anymore\" /></p>\n<p>The list effectively now holds <strong>a way to reach</strong> each value instead of the real values. We can get more generic and greatly simplify it by saying that in each list item there is a recipe to reach each value. In the above picture this <em>recipe</em> generalization is represented by the red arrows.</p>\n<p>Let me try to simplify it with the hope that it might stand out the intended purpose.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_lazy2.png\" alt=\"A list of recipes can be a list of values\" /></p>\n<p>The term <em>recipe</em> is not chosen by chance: it represents something that must be done to produce the value that the list item holds.</p>\n<p>If we follow the <em>recipe</em> in each item we can get to the intended values. For instance, suppose that this is a list of JS Number's, a good recipe to produce the value would be to just call Number() on the data. If it was a list of String's, a good recipe would be to call String() on the data. This also holds for very complex values, say this is a list of balanced tree's, or your favourite custom complex data type, <strong>a recipe is the way to construct the value</strong>, could just be following a pointer but perhaps that would not be a very useful constructor due to being too general.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lazy-concat\">Lazy concat</h3>\n<p>In our previous look into <em>concat</em> we noticed that it was a heavy operation, requiring a full copy of the first list that we want to join. When working with immutable data there are only a few of these &quot;heavy&quot; operations that do need a full copy.</p>\n<p>Now that we are taking quality steps as chefs how about we use a <em>recipe</em> for concat ?</p>\n<p>Instead of doing a full copy of the first list, just copy the first element and make it point to a recipe. That way, no matter the size of the lists, concat would be done in a single operation (the first item). Here it is in a picture:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immutable_concat_lazy.png\" alt=\"Why copy the whole first list if we don't know if it will be needed ?\" /></p>\n<p>Now if we need the second element of the list the recipe will be followed to get it.</p>\n<p>That is a simple recipe:\ncopy the first list up to the needed value, if the copying is done but the intended value is not yet reached then start going through the second list values (without copying them). In the case we want the 2nd value of a concat'ed list a single copy will happen because we already copied the first item when concat was called. This is a case where the recipe is itself the whole concat operation, meaning that it will only copy until the end of the first list and after it will use the reference of the second list.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk\"><em>recipe</em></a> approach is usually known as laziness and typically enhanced with a cache of results to avoid copying and constructing the same values over again (this caching approach is known as &quot;memoization&quot;).</p>\n<h2 id=\"cuisine-du-monde\">Cuisine du monde</h2>\n<p>Immutable.js makes good use of these techniques to avoid doing work when necessary and unnecessary copies. Their approach is lean and well thought, clearly separating the values from the way they are traversed.</p>\n<p>Lets look at our Immutable approach again:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const defaultPt = new Pt();\nconst testLst = Immutable.Repeat(defaultPt, 10000);\ntestLst.first().x;\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>A few things stand out:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We are always using the same reference <em>defaultPt</em> instead of creating a new value in each item.\n<ul>\n<li>This is possible thanks to immutability, if we change it we are effectively creating a new value and a new list.</li>\n<li>Immutability encourages reutilization and is typically a GC friendly approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Repeat just returns a <em>recipe</em> (thunk)\n<ul>\n<li>No heavy work is actually done, it just returns a way to access and construct the values</li>\n<li>We used 10000 but could have used infinite with no performance or memory hit</li>\n<li>Work is only done when values are being requested and only up until them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Immutable.js also uses a few other tricks to speed up common operations. For instance their List approach uses deques, which means that it keeps your list split in two, so [1,2,3,4,5,6] is kept by Immutable as [1,2,3] and [6,5,4] (reversed rest). This is a very simplified explanation of it, but in practice it allows for very fast insertions in the beginning and end of the list (<a href=\"http://blog.klipse.tech/javascript/2016/06/23/immutable-perf.html\">faster than JS arrays</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Immutable is certainly a different way of doing JS. Given the normal tendency JS coders have to lean more towards object oriented concepts, immutable feels like the schrodinger's immigrant in a foreign land.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/immigrant.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I hope this post was in any way useful to you. Immutable sure is a fun library to get to know and work with. </p>\n",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/Lisbon_gridgenerator1.jpg\" alt=\"Diptych of Lisbon graffitti in portuguese tiles together with the downtown Lisbon ground\" /></p>\n<p>Recently I was somewhat &quot;forced&quot; to think about the story behind the idea I am working on. If you go to these startup and entrepreneurship events you will see that most projects have some kind of a story behind them.\nEither they start up in a garage (Apple), or they decided to improve their hobbyist girl discrimination app (facebook), or they just somehow were blessed by some mystical event that got their idea and team together to disrupt the universe.</p>\n<p>When my reality clashed with that one I realized that I did not have a special motivation to do a <a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\">pattern and shapes app</a> besides my desire to make a cool project come to life.\nSo I decided to do what it seemed like the best approach to move forward: I lead myself into a spiral of paranoia and depression for not taking in consideration the necessary planets alignment.</p>\n<p>Afterall, why am I doing what I am doing ? Why drawing ? Why shapes and patterns ? What is my story ? How do I sell my idea ? What drives my &quot;pitch&quot; ?\nAll entrepreneurs seem to have the answers for these questions well sorted out as they always come up with some amazing tale of fortune and success.</p>\n<p>Me?\nI am just a person who worked in the public sector for 6 years. Quit out of frustration. Worked 2 months for a consulting company. Quit out of more frustration. Worked less than a year in a startup and quit to avoid medical insanity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Lisbon_gridgenerator2.jpg\" alt=\"A random person walking downwards with a building frontage covered in tiles in the background\" /></p>\n<p>Since college that I am full of myself with photography. I really think that I am the last Coca-Cola in the desert in regards to photography.\nInstead of studying for the exams I would spend hours roaming around Lisbon and taking pictures of every little bit of this city. I would then proceed to use them to produce poems that were even more pretentious than the pictures.\nWhich inevitably led me to fail a lot of years in university. I have pictures to show for it :)</p>\n<p>Lucky for me Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, so some pictures turned out ok in spite of my lack of talent for photography. The ones that were good were mostly about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tagus scenery (hard to miss)</li>\n<li>Buildings frontages</li>\n<li>Portuguese sidewalks</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Lisbon_gridgenerator3.jpg\" alt=\"A building in Lisbon\" /></p>\n<p>The ammount of patterns and small details in Lisbon is impressive. Be it on the walls, or on the ground, or inside or outside of buildings. I guess this is the only explanation I can think of for my interest in shapes and geometric patterns.</p>\n<p>In a few days Lisbon will be full of people from different culture(s) who are coming in for the WebSummit. If you are visiting don't forget to look at the floors and walls.\nThey are a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Lisbon_gridgenerator4.jpg\" alt=\"Diptych of a messed up sidewalk diagonal grid and the door detail of a church in &quot;Martim Moniz&quot; where the frontage is entirely rendered on the ground sidewalk\" /></p>\n<p>If you liked this post <a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\">check out my project</a> and the reason why <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/why-i-decided-to-go-to-the-websummit/\">I am going to the WebSummit</a></p>\n",
