		<p>The last 6 months?</p>
<p>Rents rising, IRS, grants and the version 0 of my personal project</p>
<h2 id="a-lisbon-story-part-i-eviction">A Lisbon Story (part I - eviction)</h2>
<p>Renting cycles have always happened. In certain cities you can even map whole migrations as they trend and landlords surf the wave of higher rent prices for at least the same level of preocupations.</p>
<p>Roughly 18 years ago I moved to Lisbon to study. For me it represented moving away from my village into the unknown. More than going to a big school where I did not know anyone. It was the city that drove my fears and desire to explore and know more. To wander and find new neighborhoods with different cultures and habits than mine.</p>
<p>Nowadays these neighborhoods still exist, but their inhabitants have mostly been evicted and moved to the outskirts. We branded this as &quot;gentrification&quot;. Gentlemen move to the place where you were previously living (notice that you are excluded from the gentlemen group by definition).</p>
<p>In Lisbon this did not happen softly. Most of my friends are now evicted. The red flags are everywhere.</p>
<p>My landlord sent me an SMS the other day. He said he wanted to speak to me about some important matters. I cannot think of anything good coming from a conversation with a landlord. He evicted me. Why charge 'n' to normal people when you can charge gentlemen 'n'*4? No problem, time for a change anyway.</p>
<h2 id="a-lisbon-story-part-ii-debt">A Lisbon Story (part II - debt)</h2>
<p>The city has been a major part of my lifestyle for the last 18 years. I managed to reduce my cost of living to under â‚¬700/month and still save a little. This was in no small part due to my rent. It might seem crazy but some neighbors of mine even manage to spend less through heroic frugal tactics.</p>
<p>With this I decided to collect my savings from the bank and dedicate full-time to develop a painting application that could help me and eventually others to do shapes and patterns like the ones from tiles.</p>
<p>Grid Generator has been a central part of my life since then.</p>
<p>Somewhere on my journey I managed to get a grant to work on it. With the obligation to build a company shortly after it finished. It has ended in May.</p>
<p>In an unrelated event to the eviction I got contacted by the IRS roughly on the same week that I got evicted. Because I was using my savings before I am old and/or dying from a terminal disease it seems that I now have to pay them a cumulative 10% of some amount for each year that I saved.</p>
<p>After some calculations the IRS lady told me that the total I needed to pay them was more money than I had in my account. Fuck. I mean: FUCK. It is said that in Portugal you can owe money to a lot of people. Rich people. Banks. Mafia. Drug dealers. But you simply cannot owe money to the IRS. Ever. Dark stories are told about people who once owed them money.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately&quot; the Portuguese IRS shady tactics are so common that they allow you to pay in small parts and through some other weird mechanics that delay your entry into their shitlist.</p>
<p>The words of a friend that is into cryptocurrencies echoed in my mind: <em>&quot;The current economic system was not made to help you save money&quot;</em>. How I wish he was wrong.</p>
<h2 id="forward-momentum">Forward momentum</h2>
<p>Grid Generator has been my testbed for a lot of strange experimentations and ideas. Not only in the approach to solve the problems it intends (shape editor, color picker, etc...) but specially in the code.</p>
<p>I have rewritten it completely from scratch some 4 times with varying degrees of (in)success. In its current state it is done with typescript and infernojs. While in its previous incarnations used react, vanilla js, immutable js and even did a quick stroll through purescript. It currently runs on top of DragonflyBSD.</p>
<p>The project is online and ready to use at <a href="https://gridgenerator.com">https://gridgenerator.com</a>.</p>
<p>I call it &quot;version 0&quot; as it lacks a lot of features (like onboarding) and has all that coder design/UX that you hate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum it up, I now have four major problems to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get money to pay the debt</li>
<li>Get a house to live</li>
<li>Build a company (with what money?)</li>
<li>Continue improving Grid Generator and start talking about it</li>
</ol>
<p>I am shifting some of the energy away from Grid Generator to focus it on the first two of these problems and see how it goes.</p>
<p>I am also going to invest into propaganda now and try to walk the thin line of project promotion and SPAM.</p>

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/abertura02.jpg\" alt=\"Paddy Cosgrave taking a selfie on the Center Stage during the opening night\" /></p>\n<p>WebSummit first day came with a mix of up and downs sprinkled with the duality of having the desire to scream with euphoria versus admiting that the event is nothing special to avoid stressing about it.</p>\n<p>This week I was contacted by their team to go up on the main stage with some of the startups that were present in last week event with the President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. That gave me cold sweats even though I knew it was nothing special. The idea was just to go on stage when they called for us and be there representing our startup scene.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, I went to the venue with high hopes of doing my registration and never think about WebSummit until the main stage opening night thing. Unfortunately they told me that registration would only happen after 12h, which made me go back home to spend the rest of the day printing and cutting flyers and cards to hopefully distribute to people at the event.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura05.jpg\" alt=\"Entrepreneurs in the opening night, on the left I didn't get the contact, on the right is Dinara Rakhimbaeva of ExpoChat\" /></p>\n<p>Later at night, I had the meeting point with the WebSummit team nearby the pavillion where the opening night was going to happen. They routed all of us through a tunnel that gave access to the spectators area of the pavillion. From the speakers that attended I really enjoyed Margrethe Vestager, the european comissioner for competition, she spoke about markets and taxes to tech companies. I also liked a lot of the speech that AntÃ³nio Guterres gave, the former prime-minister of Portugal and now secretary-general of the United Nations who spoke about the biggest difficulty of our generation: climate change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura04.jpg\" alt=\"AntÃ³nio Costa waiting to press the button\" /></p>\n<p>The cerimony was closed with the current prime-minister of Portugal, AntÃ³nio Costa, and the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, who both pressed in a button that made a lot of confettis cannons explode. Before that they invited the portuguese startups the stage, where I was included. I used the chance to take a few pictures and wave at Guterres and Margrethe when by chance they looked at me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/abertura03.jpg\" alt=\"WebSummit starting\" /></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>The purpose of this post is to introduce my personal project: Grid Generator. This is the first post about it since it went online on the 1st of July 2018.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problem-does-it-solve\">What problem does it solve?</h2>\n<p>I have always struggled with design tools. In particular those that came to see the light of the day during the 90's (Adobe I am looking at you).</p>\n<p>These design tools are clearly targeted at &quot;pros&quot; and &quot;specialists&quot; (like most of the computer &quot;stuff&quot; from/during the 90's). You are not expected to be able to work with them if you are not a specialist or if you did not take at least a course on these tools.</p>\n<p>Being trained in software development made me look at the works produced by designers with wonder and amazement. I want to be able to at least produce geometric clean shapes that fit well together.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately making even simple shapes in the current design software offer is a daunting task for me.</p>\n<p>That was my motivation behind Grid Generator: Create simple shapes, easily pick colors, and paint them in a grid, making patterns or more complex shapes.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to bring time into play. Time is an important factor to consider and to work with in Grid Generator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to expect?</h2>\n<p>A square grid. In this version, and in the upcoming near versions, Grid Generator only supports a base square grid.</p>\n<p>Think of it as pixel art with configurable pixels. Where your moves are being recorded.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/grid1.png\" alt=\"Simple house with squares, triangles, and a rounded square\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/grid2.png\" alt=\"The same with the grid hidden\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"shape-editor\">Shape editor</h3>\n<p>In a square grid the base shape is the square. If you click on the '+' button bellow left, it opens the &quot;Shape Editor&quot;. Here you are presented with a grid made of lines and circles. This is where you customize your square. The intersections are automatically calculated to help you create your shapes. You as an artist/designer only need to connect the dots and build your shape.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shape_editor.png\" alt=\"Just connect the dots\" /></p>\n<p>You can pile many shapes on top of each other and change their colors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shape_editor_pile.png\" alt=\"Several sub-shapes on the same shape\" /></p>\n<p>Time is an important aspect, you can go back to any previous state of your shapes and re-edit them from there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shape_editor_travel.png\" alt=\"Several sub-shapes on the same shape\" /></p>\n<p>After your shape is created you can start painting with it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shape_editor_paint.png\" alt=\"Paint your new shape on the main grid\" /></p>\n<p>Or create other color variations of it on the '+' button to the right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shape_editor_colors.png\" alt=\"Create several color variations for your shape\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"tile-patterns\">Tile Patterns</h3>\n<p>I have asked in reddit about software to create tile patterns. A few answers came up but none quite filled my taste. I used this as a motivation to implement automatic tile patterns in Grid Generator.</p>\n<p>In the menu just click on the &quot;pattern&quot; icon, and then on the &quot;grid&quot;. A blue frame shows up where you can paint inside and everything gets repeated outside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/grid_pattern.png\" alt=\"The pattern frame\" /></p>\n<p>You can drag the corners of the blue frame to adjust your pattern to your drawing and create different patterns with white spaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/grid_pattern_tri.png\" alt=\"A triangular pattern\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"replay-your-art\">Replay your art</h3>\n<p>After having created something cool you can publish it to share with your friends. Publishing an artwork makes it publicly available in its own page.</p>\n<p>In there you will see a big &quot;play&quot; button that will replay your creative process until the final state is reached.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com/p/13\">Check it out.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"remix-it\">Remix it</h3>\n<p>You can pick any state of the art being replayed and remix your own version from there on. You can easily create your variations by clicking on the remix button (&quot;Change It&quot; on the bottom).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/remix_grid.png\" alt=\"Remix other works and create variations\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"export\">Export</h3>\n<p>Exporting is currently the only paid feature of Grid Generator. My logic to make this a paid feature was that you can support the further development of this app if you are producing anything of value with it.</p>\n<p>In the future I am planning to make this a free feature by adding other sources of revenue like instant product creations with your art (bags, t-shirts, etc...) and even selling packs of specially crafted grids.</p>\n<p>After paying you can export your work as SVG. SVG is a vector format that is very prone to rounding errors and aliasing, so I also implemented exporting your works as high-res PNG's that solve these issues.</p>\n<p>Another possibility you have is to export your creative process as GIF or MP4, saving you the hard work of screen recording and editing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-features\">Upcoming features</h2>\n<p>The next version (v1) will mostly see UI/UX improvements (imo those are critically needed) and some small features with these, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possibility to clear your shapes in the shape editor</li>\n<li>Rough onboarding</li>\n<li>Slightly better menus and pages</li>\n<li>Facebook login</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these I am planning some major stuff like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stroke support in shapes</li>\n<li>Background images in shapes</li>\n<li>Layers</li>\n<li>Color picker enhancements</li>\n<li>Triangular grids and shapes</li>\n<li>Custom base grid editor (create any kind of base grid)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try it and if you feel inspired tell me which features you would like to see most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridgenerator.com\">https://gridgenerator.com</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In its current state Grid Generator is very raw. I did a lot of compromises to get here but the idea is very close to its initial inception in my head from a couple of years ago. Along the way I had the help and feedback of amazing people. I have some upcoming posts planned on them. They helped a lot of this feel way less lonely and in some points I think they believed more in it than me :)</p>\n<p>Alas <a href=\"https://github.com/HugoDaniel/gridgenerator\">everything is open source</a> and I am going to start using GitHub bells and whistles in its further development.</p>\n",
