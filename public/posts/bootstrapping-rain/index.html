		<p>It has passed a year and a couple of months since I started bootstrapping &quot;a painting web app&quot;. A lot has happened since that time, here is a quick TL;DR:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am still living off my savings (with a bit of help explained bellow)</li>
<li>Increase in frequency and amplitude of the emotional roller-coaster highs and lows</li>
<li>I started learning how to dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbAbbodH7Dw">kuduro</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VtDFi4m_PU">kizomba and semba</a> to cope with 2</li>
<li>Had some unexpected expenses (teeth problems, car problems, general problems, problems problems, etc...)</li>
<li>Lots of noise</li>
</ol>
<p>Noise that I now take a careful distant look at and collide for you in this blog post by applying three different filters into it.</p>
<h2 id="1-what-am-i-doing">1. What am i doing ?</h2>
<p>Many signals exist in the noise, among these the strongest ones imply that I don't have a clue about what I am doing. In life.</p>
<p>After all this time one of the hardest challenges I still have is explaining to a random person what the project is about. Come to think of it I haven't even done it here, how could I avoid my personal blog ? that blog that I personaly chose to neglect. Wait no further, here it goes.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;A painting web app&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This is a really reducing way of explaining what the project is about. Specificity wise I put it right after of <em>&quot;It's a programming project&quot;</em>, or <em>&quot;It's a web page&quot;</em>. It doesn't say much more than these and whenever I use it people stare at me with that awkward face that blends simpathy with honest disapointment.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how it happened</strong></p>
<p>Back in the day I grew tired of my (many) wrong choices in life. This was particularly hard for me since I have always been a lover of what is wrong and bad. &quot;Wasting&quot; huge ammounts of time doing code for no reason/purpose at all is not good and certainly not right. Investing years trying to produce CG code worthy of any unknown demoparty and their attendees acids. Realizing that I am not a good coder and still betting my life on the craft. Travelling through deserts only to hope <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x67s70">nobody sees my attempts at hoping to intoxicate with colors</a>.</p>
<p>It is 5am.
Another cold winter morning in Lisbon enhanced by the summer optimized windows and walls of my 37m^2 home. The rain leaks through the windows and I move the small ikea table enough to protect the laptop from getting wet. I don't know why I am forcing myself to wake up this early, perhaps knowing that the queue to heaven is shorter at this time of the day and that maybe god will allow my body and mind the grace of being numb for the rest of the working day.</p>
<p>I can see work blowing up somewhere later in the day, I can feel it devouring my brain. I need this time to breathe. The warm coffee smell keeps me awake, its scent rises above all the burn bruises my hands acquired in trying to make it half-awake. Maybe the blessing will rain down on me today.</p>
<p>I have been reading <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">this article about hexagonal grids</a> for some time now. <em>Fuck! Why can't I implement it right ? Why is programming so hard for me ?</em> I have been trying to do this for months now. I have no purpose in it besides avoiding the razors in my day.</p>
<p>Offset coordinates ? Cube coordinates ? <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=grid">If I was a designer what would I do ? What would I need ?</a></p>
<p>Hmm....</p>
<p><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1483510-Mystery-Project-50"><img src="/images/mystery_project.jpg" alt="ZX Spectrum color palette" /></a></p>
<p>It is 7am, my girlfriend will wake up at some point before 8. It is still dark outside, where did I leave the umbrella ? I go out to buy some hot bread to prepare our breakfast.</p>
<h2 id="2-holistic-approach">2. Holistic approach</h2>
<p>Romance is a big part of bootstrapping.</p>
<h2 id="3-mentor">3. Mentor</h2>
<p>In November 2016 the struggle to explain what the project is about led me to apply <a href="https://www.iapmei.pt/PRODUTOS-E-SERVICOS/Empreendedorismo-Inovacao/Empreendedorismo/Startup-Voucher.aspx">to a state sponsored funding</a>. In my mind I didn't need the money since I was/am living with low expenses on my savings, but they offered free access to a &quot;portuguese mentorship network&quot;. Mentorship that I knew that I could not afford and could not survive without. After answering their questions in a 22 page report I waited 5 months and got the response.</p>
<p>They liked the idea and decided to accept the project. I have been living the past 4 months with 690EUR/month from them. This is enough to increase my life style, cover my expenses and still manage to save a bit each month.</p>
<p>The mentorship has been great. I was not expecting such a high quality work from the mentor that I chose from their huge list of available mentors.</p>
<p>I have since done the first prototype of the landing page for the graphic design web app <a href="https://www.pixnit.com">https://www.pixnit.com</a> and we have been focusing on applying this work on colors, grids and patterns on the ceramics industry (for a different, but related, product).</p>
<p>In september I will add a promotional video for the graphic design app and an open demo.</p>

      "content": "<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like most of the country in the 80's, Alenquer, the village where I was born, was trying to modernize itself in what can be considered an insurgence against its rural past.</p>\n<p>The context of coming out from a strong harsh dictatorship and having recently joined the european comunity automatically made everyone who did not work a lazy person. Opportunities were everywhere. In fact this was so intense for the newer generations that working was not enough for them to avoid the &quot;lazy stigma&quot;. You had to explore, experiment, live and enjoy the &quot;new&quot;.</p>\n<p>I was 6 years old when my parents made their after dinner routine visit to a friends house with the usual purpose of drinking and talking about stuff that seemed to matter. What was supposed to be just another day in the company of friends changed my life forever.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;I have finally bought the computer&quot;</strong>\nhe said, on the corridor table there was a box with a screen and keys to press.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;It's a schneider&quot;</strong>\nHe turned it on, typed some words on the keys and started a game. The first computer game I saw and got the chance to play.</p>\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"157\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-y8dvsLYJM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>I had lots of questions in my mind after playing it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is it made ?</li>\n<li>How does it move as i press the buttons ?</li>\n<li>How are those colors drawn ?</li>\n<li>How can i do it ?</li>\n<li>Where can i get more of it ?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-world-is-dangerous\">The world is dangerous</h2>\n<p>Slightly older kids were having a blast with the ZX spectrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/ZXSpectrum48k.jpg\" alt=\"ZX Spectrum computer\" /></p>\n<p>It became quite famous in Portugal, companies were using it to ease some calculations, kids were pirating cassettes, and there were even local radio stations that used to broadcast entire games through the air (which you could then record in your cassette tape). Electronics done right.</p>\n<p>The speccy sported an impressive 16 color palette (15 actually, the black is repeated).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/speccy_palette.png\" alt=\"ZX Spectrum color palette\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently limited, these colors provided no limits to the fertile imagination of teens armed with a programming manual (the ZX Spectrum was sold with <a href=\"http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/\">a programming manual</a> included and no ammount of words can be used to explain the social impact this had).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/paradise_cafe.png\" alt=\"Paradise Cafe - breaking portuguese cultural and legal concepts in the 80s\" /></p>\n<p>Gravitating towards that tech and gaming oriented crowd made me later aware of a bunch of other computers that were also very important even though they were never famous here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"size-doesn-t-matter\">Size doesn't matter</h2>\n<p>The Amstrad CPC was a direct competitor of the Spectrum, it also had a base of 16 colors but expanded them into 27 in a &quot;high-resolution&quot; mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/cpc_spectrum.png\" alt=\"Amstrad vs Spectrum\" /></p>\n<p>This was a clear upgrade in comparison to the 16-colors of Spectrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/strider.png\" alt=\"The game &quot;Strider&quot; in Spectrum(left) and in the Amstrad CPC(right)\" /></p>\n<p>In spite of having more colors this palette shies when put against the mother of all 8-bit computer 16 color palettes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/C64-palette.png\" alt=\"The Commodore 64 color palette\" /></p>\n<p>These 16 colors alone allow for an amazing expression (if you are into it <a href=\"http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/misc/vic656x/colors/\">here is a detailed article</a> on how to reproduce them in RGB).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/c64_cpc.png\" alt=\"C64 on the left, CPC on the right\" /></p>\n<p>A kind soul used both color palettes (C64 and Amstrad CPC) to <a href=\"http://www.indieretronews.com/2016/02/is-c64-palette-far-superior-to-amstrad.html\">produce a set of comparison images</a>, the C64 images are more natural and its grays are better distributed which in turn allows for slightly more complex shadows.</p>\n<p>All these color palettes were made to be reproduced in TV screens from the 80's. Some even take in consideration B&amp;W TV's as full 24bit RGB was still a few years away from commodity hardware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nowadays\">Nowadays</h2>\n<p>Fast-forwarding for today, a <a href=\"http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795\">niche of people are still using 16 color palettes</a> and searching for possible combinations of colors that maximize expression. Most of these are related to &quot;pixel art&quot; communities and other minimalist art movements.</p>\n<p>Truth is that there is a natural feeling in using colors in sets of 16 related elements. It gives you, the artist, a lot of paths to explore but not many enough to degrade the exploration experience into frustration.</p>\n<p>As a final exercise I'll leave three different loader screens for the same game. Try to see if you can guess which 8-bit computer is which.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/palette1.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"/images/palette2.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"/images/palette3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Using <code>console.log()</code> to debug JavaScript, a dynamic weakly-typed interpreted language, feels like drinking beers on a lazy summer sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>It is easy and you do it without thinking too much on how you could probably be more productive doing something else.</p>\n<p>Truth is that in all the other days of the week you don't avoid spraying your code with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger\"><code>debugger</code></a> keyword and let the developer tools stop and show you the execution context at that exact location.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">function yourCodeThatCouldBeWorking() {\n  const x = 1337;\n  const y = parseInt(window.prompt(&#39;Y value:&#39;));\n  debugger; // &lt;- hello\n  return (x / y);\n}\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>But lazy summer sunday afternoons are on to get us, and <code>console.log()</code> is our friend for the mood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"console-log-basic-mode\">console.log() basic mode</h2>\n<p>The most basic usage of <code>console.log</code> is to just pass it a string. You can step this up a bit by following the string with JS objects and/or strings. Like this:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log(&quot;Vector v1: (&quot;, v1.x, &quot;,&quot;, v1.y, &quot;)&quot;);\n// or just:\nconsole.log(&quot;Vector v1:&quot;, v1);\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Try it in your developer tools console (Ctrl Shift i, or in mac Cmd Shift i).</p>\n<p>This is a particularly simple and helpful way to properly debug JavaScript. Specially if your code is creating code or functions in runtime, making it hard to setup breakpoints in the debugger window.</p>\n<p>But who needs breakpoints when we have <code>console.log</code> ? :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"colorful-console-log-composer-mode\">Colorful console.log() composer mode</h2>\n<p>Besides its simplicity, my next favourite thing in <code>console.log</code> is that it also allows you to pass a format string to be replaced with what you want:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log(&quot;v1 (%i, %i)&quot;, v1.x, v1.y);\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>There are a handful of other <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#Using_string_substitutions\">string substitutions</a> you can use.</p>\n<p>While apparently this is not a big improvement over the simplest mode, it can be used to do a few things that would not be so easy otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Colors in console.log</strong></p>\n<p>You can style your output with CSS through the %c substitution:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const v1 = { x: 123, y: 321 };\nconsole.log( &quot;%c[Vector 1] %c(%i, %i)%c\\nin object %o&quot;\n           , &quot;background: #242; color: #bada55&quot;\n           , &quot;background: #424; color: #c0ffee&quot;\n           , v1.x, v1.y\n           , &quot;&quot; //&lt;- clears style\n           , v1\n           );\n</span></code></pre>\n<p><strong>Dynamically create your output</strong></p>\n<p>You can also compose the log format string with code and pass it the args as needed.\nSuppose you are logging messages that can have a varying number of attributes:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">const someMsg =\n  { type: &quot;WORKER_ERROR&quot;\n  , action: &quot;division&quot;\n  , args: [123, 0]\n  };\n\nfunction logMessage(msg) {\n  let logFmt = &quot;%c[%s]%c - %c%s%c&quot;;\n  let logArgs =\n    [ &quot;background: #242; color: #bada55&quot;\n    , msg.type\n    , &quot;&quot;\n    , &quot;background: #424; color: #c0ffee&quot;\n    , msg.action\n    , &quot;&quot;\n    ];\n  if (msg.action === &quot;division&quot;) {\n    logFmt += &quot;: %i / %i&quot;;\n    logArgs.push(msg.args[0]);\n    logArgs.push(msg.args[1]);\n  } else {\n    logFmt += &quot; with args %o&quot;;\n    logArgs.push(msg.args);\n  }\n  // finally print it:\n  console.log(logFmt, ...logArgs);\n}\n\nlogMessage(someMsg);\n</span></code></pre><h2 id=\"measuring-console-log\">Measuring console.log()</h2>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind when using <code>console.log</code> is that it is not free. It does come with a performance hit, how much exactly ? Lets measure it like we did for <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/how-fast-is-nothing/\">requestAnimationFrame()</a>:</p>\n<p>For this test I am going to print just 32 simple console.log messages. I know that this is not a lot, it actually is nothing when compared to using console.log on mousemove events or any other fast firing event, but it should be enough to test.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">performance.mark(&quot;Before&quot;);\n// print 32 lines\nfor(let i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++)\n  console.log(&quot;One of the simplest console.log() possible&quot;, i);\nperformance.mark(&quot;After&quot;);\nperformance.measure(&quot;console.log&quot;, &quot;Before&quot;, &quot;After&quot;);\nconst totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(&quot;measure&quot;)[0].duration;\nconsole.log(&quot;console.log() in %ims&quot;, totalTime);\nperformance.clearMarks();\nperformance.clearMeasures();\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>In my Firefox Developer Edition (56.0b1) console it prints</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">&quot;console.log() in 15ms&quot;\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>15 milliseconds is <em>a lot</em> of time in a computer perspective, specially since we are just printing 32 messages, it is about 0.45ms per message.</p>\n<p>To keep it in perspective here is the time it takes to parse a huge 128KB JSON string:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">function jsonParseAndMeasure(jsonStr) {\n  performance.mark(&quot;jsonStart&quot;);\n  const json = JSON.parse(jsonStr);\n  performance.mark(&quot;jsonEnd&quot;);\n  performance.measure(&quot;JSON.parse&quot;, &quot;jsonStart&quot;, &quot;jsonEnd&quot;);\n  const totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(&quot;measure&quot;)[0].duration;\n  console.log(&quot;JSON.parse in %ims&quot;, totalTime);\n  performance.clearMarks();\n  performance.clearMeasures();\n}\n\njsonParseAndMeasure(&quot;HUGE JSON STRING HERE&quot;);\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>For a 128KB JSON string it prints:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">&quot;JSON.parse in 0ms&quot;\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Hmm... maybe that is not enough, lets increase it to a 2MB JSON string:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">&quot;JSON.parse in 0ms&quot;\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Ok... what about a 50MB JSON string ?</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">&quot;JSON.parse in 17ms&quot;\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>Thats more like it. About the same time it took console.log to print 32 simple messages. There are a few attenuating factors for this in production, but it is good to keep this in mind when leaving those debugging messages in your production code ;)</p>\n<h2 id=\"buffering-console-log\">Buffering console.log()</h2>\n<p>There is an alternative if you have your reasons to use <code>console.log</code> in production code: buffering.</p>\n<p>Instead of printing each message as it comes, lets place them in an array and dump it in a single <code>console.log</code> call every second or so.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">let buffer = [];\n// use a log function instead of directly calling console.log:\nfunction log(str, args) {\n  buffer.push({ str, args });\n}\n\nfunction printBuffer() {\n  // start by copying the buffer and clearing it\n  const buf = buffer.slice(0);\n  buffer = [];\n  // dump the buffer in a single console.log call\n  if (buf.length &gt; 0) {\n    let logStr = &quot;&quot;;\n    let logArgs = [];\n    buf.map(msg =&gt; {\n      logStr += &quot;%s, %o\\n&quot;;\n      logArgs.push(msg.str);\n      logArgs.push(msg.args);\n    });\n    console.log(logStr, ...logArgs);\n  }\n  setTimeout(printBuffer, 1000); // run every 1000ms\n}\n\nprintBuffer(); // &lt;- start it\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>That should save you some performance complaints. I hope it helps :)</p>\n",
