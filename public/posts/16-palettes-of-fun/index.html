<p>Like most of the country in the 80's, Alenquer, the village where I was born, was trying to modernize itself in what can be considered an insurgence against its rural past.</p>
<p>The context of coming out from a strong harsh dictatorship and having recently joined the european comunity automatically made everyone who did not work a lazy person. Opportunities were everywhere. In fact this was so intense for the newer generations that working was not enough for them to avoid the &quot;lazy stigma&quot;. You had to explore, experiment, live and enjoy the &quot;new&quot;.</p>
<p>I was 6 years old when my parents made their after dinner routine visit to a friends house with the usual purpose of drinking and talking about stuff that seemed to matter. What was supposed to be just another day in the company of friends changed my life forever.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I have finally bought the computer&quot;</strong>
he said, on the corridor table there was a box with a screen and keys to press.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;It's a schneider&quot;</strong>
He turned it on, typed some words on the keys and started a game. The first computer game I saw and got the chance to play.</p>
<iframe width="280" height="157" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-y8dvsLYJM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I had lots of questions in my mind after playing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it made ?</li>
<li>How does it move as i press the buttons ?</li>
<li>How are those colors drawn ?</li>
<li>How can i do it ?</li>
<li>Where can i get more of it ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Slightly older kids were having a blast with the ZX spectrum.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/ZXSpectrum48k.jpg" alt="ZX Spectrum computer" /></p>
<p>It became quite famous in Portugal, companies were using it to ease some calculations, kids were pirating cassettes, and there were even local radio stations that used to broadcast entire games through the air (which you could then record in your cassette tape). Electronics done right.</p>
<p>The speccy sported an impressive 16 color palette (15 actually, the black is repeated).</p>
<p><img src="/images/speccy_palette.png" alt="ZX Spectrum color palette" /></p>
<p>Apparently limited, these colors provided no limits to the fertile imagination of teens armed with a programming manual (the ZX Spectrum was sold with <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/">a programming manual</a> included and no ammount of words can be used to explain the social impact this had).</p>
<p><img src="/images/paradise_cafe.png" alt="Paradise Cafe - breaking portuguese cultural and legal concepts in the 80s" /></p>
<p>Gravitating towards that tech and gaming oriented crowd made me later aware of a bunch of other computers that were also very important even though they were never famous here.</p>
<h2 id="size-doesn-t-matter">Size doesn't matter</h2>
<p>The Amstrad CPC was a direct competitor of the Spectrum, it also had a base of 16 colors but expanded them into 27 in a &quot;high-resolution&quot; mode.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cpc_spectrum.png" alt="Amstrad vs Spectrum" /></p>
<p>This was a clear upgrade in comparison to the 16-colors of Spectrum.</p>
<p><img src="/images/strider.png" alt="The game &quot;Strider&quot; in Spectrum(left) and in the Amstrad CPC(right)" /></p>
<p>In spite of having more colors this palette shies when put against the mother of all 8-bit computer 16 color palettes:</p>
<p><img src="/images/C64-palette.png" alt="The Commodore 64 color palette" /></p>
<p>These 16 colors alone allow for an amazing expression (if you are into it <a href="http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/misc/vic656x/colors/">here is a detailed article</a> on how to reproduce them in RGB).</p>
<p><img src="/images/c64_cpc.png" alt="C64 on the left, CPC on the right" /></p>
<p>A kind soul used both color palettes (C64 and Amstrad CPC) to <a href="http://www.indieretronews.com/2016/02/is-c64-palette-far-superior-to-amstrad.html">produce a set of comparison images</a>, the C64 images are more natural and its grays are better distributed which in turn allows for slightly more complex shadows.</p>
<p>All these color palettes were made to be reproduced in TV screens from the 80's. Some even take in consideration B&amp;W TV's as full 24bit RGB was still a few years away from commodity hardware.</p>
<h2 id="nowadays">Nowadays</h2>
<p>Fast-forwarding for today, a <a href="http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795">niche of people are still using 16 color palettes</a> and searching for possible combinations of colors that maximize expression. Most of these are related to &quot;pixel art&quot; communities and other minimalist art movements.</p>
<p>Truth is that there is a natural feeling in using colors in sets of 16 related elements. It gives you, the artist, a lot of paths to explore but not many enough to degrade the exploration experience into frustration.</p>
<p>As a final exercise I'll leave three different loader screens for the same game. Try to see if you can guess which 8-bit computer is which.</p>

      "content": "<p>2016 was a year of change. I stopped working full-time as a programmer and decided to dedicate some of that time to personal projects. I made plans.\nDuring the course of the year most of those plans got changed, a lot. My intention was to build &quot;paint.pt&quot;, a online painting tool, while supporting myself with some savings and with the money i could make by training people in programming skills.</p>\n<p>I took teacher training and got a teacher certificate with the highest possible grade as i was full time on it.\nThen got a few schools contacts that needed trainers for specific modules of some courses.</p>\n<p>That was when I collided head-on with the portuguese reality of a fragile economy. I knew jobs were better here for programmers than for most other professions, so i was already somewhat mentally prepared to embrace a harsh reality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-ll-pay-you-next-week\">&quot;I'll pay you next week&quot;</h2>\n<p>After a few courses money didn't came. Excuses started to pile. It took a few months until the first bit of money appeared.</p>\n<p>I ran to seek advice in a multitude of older, wiser people. What should i do ?</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Hugo all of this is normal, you have to understand that most companies are struggling economically.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;In portugal companies are trying to stay above water.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;Don't expect to be paid before 6 months.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>I did try to extend my good will to parties that hire with the expectation of paying as late as possible.\nThe result of it was the realisation that ~10EUR/hour isn't enough for the time spent preparing the course, giving it and managing the debt until the employer decided to pay.</p>\n<p>Time has come to scratch the initial plan and start fresh with a new strategy for 2017.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change-of-name-change-of-plans\">Change of name, change of plans</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;What are you working on ?&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;A painting application&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Cool, whats it called ?&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;paint.pt as in paint point&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;That already exists&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A new name for the project was needed, and that is how Pixnit showed up. Pixnit a simple name that reads as &quot;pixel knit&quot; which is exactly what i want the tool to do.</p>\n<p>I believe that people want to use custom shapes to create beautiful patterns and logos so that they can express themselves better and enhance current works, and that they will find value in it because trying to create logos, icons and patterns by using traditional software is hard and takes forever. </p>\n<p>The domain was registered (pixnit.com) just in time for a complete change in strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take 1h each day to write in the blog;</li>\n<li>Don't work on anything else besides it and pixnit;</li>\n<li>Push to release self contained small parts of pixnit as soon as possible;</li>\n<li>Create a patreon;</li>\n<li>Create a landing page;</li>\n<li>Talk to people;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lets see where this goes. So no more trainings, no more certifications, no more noise. Just pixnit.</p>\n",

In life.</p>\n<p>After all this time one of the hardest challenges I still have is explaining to a random person what the project is about. Come to think of it I haven't even done it here, how could I avoid my personal blog ? that blog that I personaly chose to neglect. Wait no further, here it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;A painting web app&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>This is a really reducing way of explaining what the project is about.

It doesn't say much more than these and whenever I use it people stare at me with that awkward face that blends simpathy with honest disapointment.</p>\n<p><strong>Here is how it happened</strong></p>\n<p>Back in the day I grew tired of my (many) wrong choices in life. This was particularly hard for me since I have always been a lover of what is wrong and bad. &quot;Wasting&quot; huge ammounts of time doing code for no reason/purpose at all is not good and certainly not right. Investing years trying to produce CG code worthy of any unknown demoparty and their attendees acids. Realizing that I am not a good coder and still betting my life on the craft. Travelling through deserts only to hope <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x67s70\">nobody sees my attempts at hoping to intoxicate with colors</a>.</p>\n<p>It is 5am.\nAnother cold winter morning in Lisbon enhanced by the summer optimized windows and walls of my 37m^2 home. The rain leaks through the windows and I move the small ikea table enough to protect the laptop from getting wet. I don't know why I am forcing myself to wake up this early, perhaps knowing that the queue to heaven is shorter at this time of the day and that maybe god will allow my body and mind the grace of being numb for the rest of the working day.</p>\n<p>I can see work blowing up somewhere later in the day, I can feel it devouring my brain. I need this time to breathe. The warm coffee smell keeps me awake, its scent rises above all the burn bruises my hands acquired in trying to make it half-awake. Maybe the blessing will rain down on me today.</p>\n<p>I have been reading <a href=\"http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/\">this article about hexagonal grids</a> for some time now. <em>Fuck! Why can't I implement it right ? Why is programming so hard for me ?</em> I have been trying to do this for months now. I have no purpose in it besides avoiding the razors in my day.</p>\n<p>Offset coordinates ? Cube coordinates ? <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/search?q=grid\">If I was a designer what would I do ? What would I need ?</a></p>\n<p>Hmm....</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1483510-Mystery-Project-50\"><img src=\"/images/mystery_project.jpg\" alt=\"ZX Spectrum color palette\" /></a></p>\n<p>It is 7am, my girlfriend will wake up at some point before 8. It is still dark outside, where did I leave the umbrella ? I go out to buy some hot bread to prepare our breakfast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-holistic-approach\">2. Holistic approach</h2>\n<p>Romance is a big part of bootstrapping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-mentor\">3. Mentor</h2>\n<p>In November 2016 the struggle to explain what the project is about led me to apply <a href=\"https://www.iapmei.pt/PRODUTOS-E-SERVICOS/Empreendedorismo-Inovacao/Empreendedorismo/Startup-Voucher.aspx\">to a state sponsored funding</a>. In my mind I didn't need the money since I was/am living with low expenses on my savings, but they offered free access to a &quot;portuguese mentorship network&quot;. Mentorship that I knew that I could not afford and could not survive without. After answering their questions in a 22 page report I waited 5 months and got the response.</p>\n<p>They liked the idea and decided to accept the project. I have been living the past 4 months with 690EUR/month from them. This is enough to increase my life style, cover my expenses and still manage to save a bit each month.</p>\n<p>The mentorship has been great. I was not expecting such a high quality work from the mentor that I chose from their huge list of available mentors.</p>\n<p>I have since done the first prototype of the landing page for the graphic design web app <a href=\"https://www.pixnit.com\">https://www.pixnit.com</a> and we have been focusing on applying this work on colors, grids and patterns on the ceramics industry (for a different, but related, product).</p>\n<p>In september I will add a promotional video for the graphic design app and an open demo.</p>\n",
