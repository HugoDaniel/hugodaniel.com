		<p>2016 was a year of change. I stopped working full-time as a programmer and decided to dedicate some of that time to personal projects. I made plans.
During the course of the year most of those plans got changed, a lot. My intention was to build &quot;paint.pt&quot;, a online painting tool, while supporting myself with some savings and with the money i could make by training people in programming skills.</p>
<p>I took teacher training and got a teacher certificate with the highest possible grade as i was full time on it.
Then got a few schools contacts that needed trainers for specific modules of some courses.</p>
<p>That was when I collided head-on with the portuguese reality of a fragile economy. I knew jobs were better here for programmers than for most other professions, so i was already somewhat mentally prepared to embrace a harsh reality.</p>
<h2 id="i-ll-pay-you-next-week">&quot;I'll pay you next week&quot;</h2>
<p>After a few courses money didn't came. Excuses started to pile. It took a few months until the first bit of money appeared.</p>
<p>I ran to seek advice in a multitude of older, wiser people. What should i do ?</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hugo all of this is normal, you have to understand that most companies are struggling economically.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;In portugal companies are trying to stay above water.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Don't expect to be paid before 6 months.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I did try to extend my good will to parties that hire with the expectation of paying as late as possible.
The result of it was the realisation that ~10EUR/hour isn't enough for the time spent preparing the course, giving it and managing the debt until the employer decided to pay.</p>
<p>Time has come to scratch the initial plan and start fresh with a new strategy for 2017.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-name-change-of-plans">Change of name, change of plans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;What are you working on ?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;A painting application&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Cool, whats it called ?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;paint.pt as in paint point&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;That already exists&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A new name for the project was needed, and that is how Pixnit showed up. Pixnit a simple name that reads as &quot;pixel knit&quot; which is exactly what i want the tool to do.</p>
<p>I believe that people want to use custom shapes to create beautiful patterns and logos so that they can express themselves better and enhance current works, and that they will find value in it because trying to create logos, icons and patterns by using traditional software is hard and takes forever. </p>
<p>The domain was registered (pixnit.com) just in time for a complete change in strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take 1h each day to write in the blog;</li>
<li>Don't work on anything else besides it and pixnit;</li>
<li>Push to release self contained small parts of pixnit as soon as possible;</li>
<li>Create a patreon;</li>
<li>Create a landing page;</li>
<li>Talk to people;</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets see where this goes. So no more trainings, no more certifications, no more noise. Just pixnit.</p>

      "content": "<p>One of the fastest functions that can be run inside <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame\">requestAnimationFrame</a> goes something like this:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">\nfunction fastest() {\n  window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n}\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>A simple no-op. It does nothing besides requesting to be called in another frame in order to do nothing besides requesting to be called in another frame, and so on.\nA request for nothing that hopefully matches the speed of your monitor v-sync to hastily do just nothing.</p>\n<p>Which gives us the perfect chance to use the most important skill we have in our life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"giving-meaning-to-nothing\">Giving meaning to nothing</h2>\n<p>Measuring the function can be done by <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark\">placing marks</a> and then collecting them with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/measure\">performance.measure() function</a>. To avoid placing a mark every frame lets also count them and place it only once every 120 frames. My monitor updates at about 60Hz so this should place a mark every 2 seconds.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">let count = 0;\n// ^ count each frame\nfunction fastest() {\n  window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n  count += 1;\n  if(count === 120) {\n    performance.mark(&quot;120&quot;);\n    // ^ place a mark in the 120th\n }\n}\nperformance.mark(&quot;0&quot;);\n// ^ place a mark before the first frame\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\nwindow.setTimeout(function() {\n  // measure the duration between those two marks;\n  performance.measure(&quot;120frames&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;120&quot;);\n  const measure = performance.getEntriesByType(&quot;measure&quot;)[0];\n  console.log(&quot;120 frames in: &quot; + measure.duration);\n}, 3000);\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>At 60fps we get around 16.7ms per frame, 120 frames should run in ~2000ms. Yet after 3 seconds this code prints &quot;120 frames in: 2148.415&quot; in the console.\nThis is 8% slower, making it closer to 55fps (18.2ms) than to 60fps(16.7ms).</p>\n<p>If you thrive in the eccentricities of speed then those 1.5ms are simply unacceptable, lets try to understand what is happening by opening the &quot;Performance&quot; tab in the developer tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-eyes-are-the-window-of-the-soul-and-all-i-see-is-garbage\">The eyes are the window of the soul. And all i see is garbage.</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/measure1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the performance monitor of Firefox developer tools, it shows a maximum of 60 frames-per-second, a minimum 5.41 frames-per-second, and an average of 55.85 frames-per-second.\" /></p>\n<p>Those big drops in performance are related to the red dots of the Garbage Collector (from here on, just &quot;GC&quot;). They mark the time where GC woke up and run through the nursery of temporary objects to clean them.</p>\n<p>These GC actions happen at the rate that the code fills the nursery heap with temporary objects. The browser then performs a small cleanup on the nursery heap and checks if some of those temporary objects can be promoted to the tenured heap.</p>\n<p>The Tenured heap fills at a much lower rate than the Nursery and consequently the browser does not check it as often as the Nursery.</p>\n<p>Lets try to promote all our short lived objects into something that might be selected to be tenured by the browser, thus reducing the time that the GC spends analyzing our running code and the nursery heap.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-execution-context-is-dead-long-live-the-execution-context\">The execution context is dead. Long live the execution context!</h2>\n<p>My first approach is to remove the first invocation to the requestAnimationFrame() and place it inside a global closure in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression\">IIFE</a> style.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">let count = 0;\n(function() {\n  function fastest() {\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n    count += 1;\n    if(count === 120) {\n      performance.mark(&quot;120&quot;);\n    }\n  }\n  performance.mark(&quot;0&quot;);\n  fastest();\n  // ^ call the function directly for the first frame\n})();\n// ^ IIFE\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>The idea here is to make the reference to the fastest() function explicitly last for the whole execution of the animation loop by wrapping it in a closure context that is immediatly called.</p>\n<p>The next step is to remove all obvious objects allocations that happen inside our loop.\nThis means we need to remove all the strings (&quot;120&quot; is an object allocation) and all the numbers.</p>\n<p>One of the great things about closures is that their execution context is available in their children, this means we can place the strings and numbers of our loop in vars in the long-lived closure context instead, making them live between our loop function calls.</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#2b303b;\">\n<code><span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\">(function () {\n  let count = 0;\n  const limit = 120;\n  const lastMark = &quot;120&quot;;\n  const firstMark = &quot;0&quot;;\n  // ^ all vars go here\n  function fastest() {\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(fastest);\n    count += 1;\n    if(count === limit) {\n      performance.mark(lastMark);\n    }\n  }\n  // ^ when the fastest() context finishes there\n  // are no obvious object allocations to free\n  performance.mark(firstMark);\n  fastest();\n})();\n// setTimeout remains the same, this is just for performance measure\nwindow.setTimeout(function() {\n  performance.measure(&quot;120frames&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;120&quot;);\n  const totalTime = performance.getEntriesByType(&quot;measure&quot;)[0].duration;\n  console.log(&quot;120 frames in: &quot; + totalTime);\n}, 3000);\n</span></code></pre><h2 id=\"a-speed-freak-nighmare-is-a-control-junkie-best-dream\">A speed-freak nighmare is a control-junkie best dream</h2>\n<p>That code above produces the string &quot;120 frames in: 1990.69&quot;. This is great, it says that our measures were taken before the 16.7ms frame time has passed.</p>\n<p>Lets look at the performance tab:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/measure2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the performance monitor of Firefox developer tools, it shows a maximum of 60 frames-per-second, a minimum 38.98 frames-per-second, and an average of 57.66 frames-per-second.\" /></p>\n<p>Note that the Nursery is completely gone from our call-stack. There are still some red dots that mostly refer to the Cycle Collector (from here on, just &quot;CC&quot;) taking control of the code.</p>\n<p>The CC does a simple job: it tracks cycles in the code.</p>\n<p>A cycle happens when objects refer to each other in a way that their reference count never becomes zero. This can trick the GC to never collect them and forces the need to have a cycle counter running through the code once in a while.</p>\n<p>The CC is a tricky beast, it does not allow anything else to run while it is running. Our JavaScript stops executing (you can validate this by increasing the zoom on the developer tools waterfall when a CC action occurs).</p>\n<p>Fortunately this is not hurting the performance that much and each frame gets rendered bellow their time by the browser. I was starting to have some chills with the idea of having to frame limit the render loop to ensure a constant frame rate.</p>\n<p>Thankfully this Intel HD3000 is still good for Nothing at all :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/intel.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the chrome://gpu page list of problems. Currently chrome does not support WebGL in Intel HD3000 cards on OSX.\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rqleve\">Raquel Foster</a> for reading this blog and motivating me to write this follow-up on <a href=\"https://hugodaniel.pt/posts/react-redux-canvas/\">React-Redux-Canvas</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like most of the country in the 80's, Alenquer, the village where I was born, was trying to modernize itself in what can be considered an insurgence against its rural past.</p>\n<p>The context of coming out from a strong harsh dictatorship and having recently joined the european comunity automatically made everyone who did not work a lazy person. Opportunities were everywhere. In fact this was so intense for the newer generations that working was not enough for them to avoid the &quot;lazy stigma&quot;. You had to explore, experiment, live and enjoy the &quot;new&quot;.</p>\n<p>I was 6 years old when my parents made their after dinner routine visit to a friends house with the usual purpose of drinking and talking about stuff that seemed to matter. What was supposed to be just another day in the company of friends changed my life forever.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;I have finally bought the computer&quot;</strong>\nhe said, on the corridor table there was a box with a screen and keys to press.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;It's a schneider&quot;</strong>\nHe turned it on, typed some words on the keys and started a game. The first computer game I saw and got the chance to play.</p>\n<iframe width=\"280\" height=\"157\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-y8dvsLYJM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>I had lots of questions in my mind after playing it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is it made ?</li>\n<li>How does it move as i press the buttons ?</li>\n<li>How are those colors drawn ?</li>\n<li>How can i do it ?</li>\n<li>Where can i get more of it ?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-world-is-dangerous\">The world is dangerous</h2>\n<p>Slightly older kids were having a blast with the ZX spectrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/ZXSpectrum48k.jpg\" alt=\"ZX Spectrum computer\" /></p>\n<p>It became quite famous in Portugal, companies were using it to ease some calculations, kids were pirating cassettes, and there were even local radio stations that used to broadcast entire games through the air (which you could then record in your cassette tape). Electronics done right.</p>\n<p>The speccy sported an impressive 16 color palette (15 actually, the black is repeated).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/speccy_palette.png\" alt=\"ZX Spectrum color palette\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently limited, these colors provided no limits to the fertile imagination of teens armed with a programming manual (the ZX Spectrum was sold with <a href=\"http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/\">a programming manual</a> included and no ammount of words can be used to explain the social impact this had).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/paradise_cafe.png\" alt=\"Paradise Cafe - breaking portuguese cultural and legal concepts in the 80s\" /></p>\n<p>Gravitating towards that tech and gaming oriented crowd made me later aware of a bunch of other computers that were also very important even though they were never famous here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"size-doesn-t-matter\">Size doesn't matter</h2>\n<p>The Amstrad CPC was a direct competitor of the Spectrum, it also had a base of 16 colors but expanded them into 27 in a &quot;high-resolution&quot; mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/cpc_spectrum.png\" alt=\"Amstrad vs Spectrum\" /></p>\n<p>This was a clear upgrade in comparison to the 16-colors of Spectrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/strider.png\" alt=\"The game &quot;Strider&quot; in Spectrum(left) and in the Amstrad CPC(right)\" /></p>\n<p>In spite of having more colors this palette shies when put against the mother of all 8-bit computer 16 color palettes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/C64-palette.png\" alt=\"The Commodore 64 color palette\" /></p>\n<p>These 16 colors alone allow for an amazing expression (if you are into it <a href=\"http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/misc/vic656x/colors/\">here is a detailed article</a> on how to reproduce them in RGB).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/c64_cpc.png\" alt=\"C64 on the left, CPC on the right\" /></p>\n<p>A kind soul used both color palettes (C64 and Amstrad CPC) to <a href=\"http://www.indieretronews.com/2016/02/is-c64-palette-far-superior-to-amstrad.html\">produce a set of comparison images</a>, the C64 images are more natural and its grays are better distributed which in turn allows for slightly more complex shadows.</p>\n<p>All these color palettes were made to be reproduced in TV screens from the 80's. Some even take in consideration B&amp;W TV's as full 24bit RGB was still a few years away from commodity hardware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nowadays\">Nowadays</h2>\n<p>Fast-forwarding for today, a <a href=\"http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795\">niche of people are still using 16 color palettes</a> and searching for possible combinations of colors that maximize expression. Most of these are related to &quot;pixel art&quot; communities and other minimalist art movements.</p>\n<p>Truth is that there is a natural feeling in using colors in sets of 16 related elements. It gives you, the artist, a lot of paths to explore but not many enough to degrade the exploration experience into frustration.</p>\n<p>As a final exercise I'll leave three different loader screens for the same game. Try to see if you can guess which 8-bit computer is which.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/palette1.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"/images/palette2.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"/images/palette3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",
